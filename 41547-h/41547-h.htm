<h2>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>It is not my intention to expatiate in these prefatory
remarks on the present work and its author. A history of the
Jews in Russia and Poland from the pen of S. M. Dubnow
needs neither justification nor recommendation. The want of
a work of this kind has long been keenly felt by those interested
in Jewish life or Jewish letters, never more keenly than to-day
when the flare of the world conflagration has thrown into
ghastly relief the tragic plight of the largest Jewry of the
Diaspora. As for the author, his power of grasping and presenting
the broad aspects of general Jewish history and his
lifelong, painstaking labors in the particular field of Russian-Jewish
history fit him in singular measure to cope with the
task to which this work is dedicated.</p>

<p>In what follows I merely wish to render account of the
English translation and of the form of the original which it
has endeavored to reproduce.</p>

<p>The translation is based upon a work in Russian which was
especially prepared by Mr. Dubnow for <span class="smcap">The Jewish Publication
Society of America</span>. Those acquainted with modern
Jewish literature in the Russian language know that the
author of our book has treated the same subject in his general
history of the Jewish people, in three volumes, and in a number
of special studies published by him in the periodical
<i>Yevreyskaya Starina</i> ("Jewish Antiquity"). Upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
material Mr. Dubnow has freely drawn for the present work,
after subjecting it to a careful revision, and so supplementing
and co-ordinating it that to all intents and purposes the book
issued herewith is a new and independent publication. Moreover,
the history of Russian Jewry after 1881, comprising the
gruesome era of pogroms and expulsions, has been written by
Mr. Dubnow entirely anew, and will appear for the first time
as part of this work. The present publication may thus
properly claim to give the first comprehensive and systematic
account of the history of Russo-Polish Jewry.</p>

<p>The work is divided into two volumes. The first volume,
now offered to the public, contains the history of the Jews of
Russia and Poland from its beginnings until the death of
Alexander I., in 1825. The second volume will continue the
historic narrative up to the very threshold of the present. The
book was originally scheduled to appear at a later date. The
great events of our time, which have made the question of
Russian Jewry a part of the world problem, suggested the
importance of earlier publication. In order that there might
be as little delay as possible in giving the book to the public,
the maps and the bibliographical apparatus were reserved for
the second volume. The same volume, which, it is hoped, will
appear in the course of this year, will contain also the index
to the whole work.</p>

<p>My task as translator has been considerably facilitated by
the self-abnegation of the author, who gave me permission to
act as editor and to adapt the original to the requirements of
an English version. I have made frequent use of the privilege
accorded to me, and have endeavored throughout to bridge the
wide gap which stretches between the Russian and American
reading public in matters of literary taste. This editorial
activity includes a number of changes in the framework of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
book, which was originally divided into sections of disproportionate
length, and has now been arranged in a more uniform
manner. In the course of this rearrangement, it became
necessary to change the wording of some of the headings so as
to bring them into greater conformity with English literary
usage. It should be pointed out, however, that the changes
made are of a stylistic nature, or relate only to the skeleton
of the book. With the exception of a few passages, they leave
the contents untouched, and the responsibility for the latter
rests entirely with the author.</p>

<p>As translator I had resolved to keep myself in the background
and act solely as the interpreter of the author. Much
to my regret I found myself unable to maintain this attitude
uniformly. The text was already in type when it was borne
in upon me that the subject of the book, dealing as it does
with the lands of Eastern Europe, was a <i>terra incognita</i> to the
average American reader, and that many things in it must
perforce be wholly or partly unintelligible to him if left without
an explanation. There was nothing for me to do but to
step into the breach and supply the deficiency. I did so by
adding a number of footnotes, which, in distinction from those
of the author, are placed in brackets. With very few exceptions
these notes are not of a supplementary, but of an explanatory,
nature. They are confined to such information as the
reader may need to grasp the full bearing of the text. I trust
that in some small measure these detached notes may serve
instead of a systematic account of the general development of
Eastern Europe, which, it was originally hoped, might be supplied
by the authoritative pen of Mr. Dubnow himself, as a
background for the history of Russo-Polish Jewry. An attempt
in this direction, within a narrow compass and with no pretense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to completeness, has been undertaken by the present writer in
a recent publication of his own.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>A word must be said concerning the spelling of foreign
names and terms, which are naturally numerous in a work
like the present. After considerable deliberation I decided
on the phonetic method, as being the most convenient from
the point of view of the reader. I have consequently endeavored
to reproduce, as far as possible, the original sounds of all
foreign words in English characters. In conformity with this
principle, I have adopted the spelling <i>Tzar</i>, instead of <i>Czar</i>.
As far as I am aware, the only exception is the Russian word
<i>ukase</i>, which reflects in its spelling the effect of French transmission,
and is to be pronounced <i>ookaz</i>, with the accent on the
last syllable. Needless to say I have had to resort to artificial
contrivances to indicate those sounds which are unknown in
English, but I have reduced these contrivances to a minimum.
They are as follows: <i>zh</i> represents the Slavic sound which
corresponds to French <i>j</i>; <i>kh</i> stands for the sound which is
to be pronounced like hard German <i>ch</i> (as in <i>lachen</i>, not as
in <i>brechen</i>); <i>tz</i> is the equivalent of a Slavic letter which is to
be pronounced like German <i>z</i>. To avoid mispronunciation,
<i>g</i> in all foreign words has been spelled <i>gh</i> before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i>. <i>U</i> in
these words is to be pronounced like <i>oo</i>, and <i>a</i> like French and
short German <i>a</i>. With every desire for uniformity, I have
yet little doubt that inconsistencies will be found, particularly
in the transliteration of Hebrew, which, as a Semitic idiom,
is more difficult of phonetic reproduction than are even the
Slavic languages. I hope that these inconsistencies are not
numerous enough to be offensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>The method of transliteration referred to in the foregoing
presents a special difficulty in the case of Polish names, in
view of the fact that the Polish language uses the general
European alphabet, and that the Polish spelling of such names
has found access to other languages. In some instances even
the question of identity may arise. Thus, to quote but one
example out of many, the name <i>Chmielnicki</i>, written in this
form in Polish, differs considerably from the phonetic spelling
<i>Khmelnitzk</i>i, adopted in this volume. To meet this difficulty,
the index to this work will give all Polish names and expressions
both in their transliterated English forms and in their
original Polish spelling.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is my pleasant duty to record my appreciation
of the help rendered me in my task. I am indebted
to the Honorable Mayer Sulzberger for his great kindness in
reading the proofs of this volume and in giving me the benefit
of his subtle literary judgment. Professor Alexander Marx
has assisted me by reading the proofs and making a number
of suggestions. My thanks are finally due to Miss Henrietta
Szold for her indefatigable and most valuable co-operation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> "The Jews of Russia and Poland. A Bird's-Bye View of Their
History and Culture" (G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1915). To avoid any
misconception on the part of the reader, I desire to point out that
the aim and scope of my little volume are totally different from
those of Mr. Dubnow's work. As indicated in the title of my
sketch, and as stated in the preface to it, my purpose was none
other than to present a "bird's-eye view" of the subject, to point
out the large bearings of the problem, with no intention on my
part "to offer new and independent results of investigation."
The publication is based on a course of lectures delivered by me
before the Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning in
Philadelphia in March, 1915. My natural reluctance to anticipate
Mr. Dubnow's large work was overcome by the encouragement
of several friends, among them Mr. Dubnow himself, who, from
their knowledge of public affairs, thought that a succinct, popular
presentation of the destinies of the Jews in the Eastern war area
was a word in due season.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
THE JEWISH DIASPORA IN EASTERN EUROPE</h2>


<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Jewish Settlements on the Shores of the
Black Sea</span></p>

<p>From the point of view of antiquity the Jewish Diaspora in
the east of Europe is the equal of that in the west, though
vastly its inferior in geographic expansion and spiritual development.
It is even possible that the settlement of Jews in
the east of Europe antedates their settlement in the west. For
Eastern Europe, beginning with Alexander the Great, received
its immigrants from the ancient lands of Hellenized Asia,
while the immigration into Western Europe proceeded in the
main from the Roman Empire, the heir to the Hellenic
dominion of the East.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Jewish settlements in Eastern Europe
the colonies situated on the northern shores of the Black Sea,
now forming a part of the Russian Empire, occupy a prominent
place.</p>

<p>Far back in antiquity the Greeks of Asia Minor and the
Ionian Islands gravitated towards the northern shores of the
Pontus Euxinus, the fertile lands of Tauris&mdash;the present
Crimea.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Beginning with the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.E.</span>, they established
their colonies in those parts, whence they exported corn
to their homeland, Greece. When, after the conquests of Alexander
the Great, Judea became a part of the Hellenistic Orient,
and sent forth the "great Diaspora" into all the dominions of
the Seleucids and Ptolemies, one of the branches of this Diaspora
must have reached as far as distant Tauris. Following in
the wake of the Greeks, the Jews wandered thither from Asia
Minor, that conglomerate of countries and cities&mdash;Cilicia,
Galatia, Miletus, Ephesus, Sardis, Tarsus&mdash;which harbored,
at the beginning of the Christian era, important Jewish communities,
the earliest nurseries of Christianity. In the first
century of the Christian era, which marks the consolidation of
the Roman power over the Hellenized East, we meet in the
Greek colonies of Tauris with fully organized Jewish communities,
which undoubtedly represent offshoots of a much older
colonization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>During the same period there flourished in the Crimea and
on the adjacent shores of the Black and Azov Seas, called by
the Greeks Pontus and Maeotis, in the lands of the Scythians,
Sarmatians, and Taurians, a number of diminutive Greek city-republics&mdash;Cimmerian
Bosporus, or Panticapaeum (at present
Kerch), Phanagoria (the Taman Peninsula), Olbia, Gorgippia
(now Anapa), and others. The most active of these colonies
was Bosporus-Panticapaeum, which was situated at the confluence
of the Black and Azov Seas. The kings, or archonts,
of Bosporus, of the Greek dynasty of the Rhescuporides, acknowledged
the sovereignty of Rome. They styled themselves,
in accordance with the customary formula, "friends of the
Caesars and the Romans," and frequently added to their title
the Roman dynastic appellation "Tiberius-Julius." The
Jewish historian Josephus Flavius, in depicting the irresistible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
sway of the Roman world-power in his time, refers to this
colony in the following terms: "Why need I speak of the
Heniochi and Colchians and the nation of the Tauri, and those
who inhabit the Bosporus and the nations about Pontus and
Maeotis ... who are now subject to three thousand armed
men, and where forty long ships keep in peace the sea which
before was unnavigable, and is very tempestuous?" (Bell.
Jud. II. xvi. 4.) These words were written shortly after the
downfall of Judea, about the year 80 of the Christian era.</p>

<p>Now from practically the same year (80-81) date the Greek
inscriptions which were discovered on the soil of ancient Bosporus
in Tauris, testifying to the existence there of a well-organized
Jewish community, with a house of prayer. The
following is the text of one of these inscriptions, engraved on a
marble tablet which is kept in the Hermitage of Petrograd:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the reign of King Tiberius Julius Rhescuporides, the pious
friend of the Caesars and the Romans, in the year 377,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> on the
twelfth day of the month of Peritios, I, Chresta, formerly the wife
of Drusus, declare in the house of prayer (προσευχή) that my foster-son
Heracles is free once [for all], in accordance with my vow, so
that he may not be captured or annoyed by my heirs, and may move
about wherever he chooses, without let or hindrance, except for [the
obligation of visiting] the house of prayer for worship and constant
attendance. [Done] with the approval of my heirs Iphicleides
and Heliconias, and with the participation of the Synagogue of the
Jews in the guardianship (συνεπιτροπευούσης δὲ καὶ τῆς συναγωγῆς τῶν Ἰουδαίων).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>This inscription, paralleled by a similar document of the
same period, was evidently meant to certify the act of liberating
a slave, which, according to custom, was performed
publicly, in the "house of prayer," with the participation of
the representatives of the Jewish community.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The contents of the inscriptions enable us to draw the following
conclusions bearing on the history of the Jews during
that period:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The Jewish community in Taurian Bosporus was made up
of Hellenized Jews, who employed the Greek language in their
religious and civil documents, and called themselves by Greek
names (Chresta, Drusus, Heracles, Artemisia, etc.). 2. While
assimilated to the Greeks in point of language, they were firmly
united among themselves by the bond of religion, as is shown
by the obligation, imposed even on the freedman, the <i>libertinus</i>,
to visit the house of prayer for worship. 3. The Jewish community
enjoyed a certain amount of civil autonomy, as shown in the case
cited above, in which the community appears in the rôle of a juridical
person, acting as the guardian of the liberated slaves.</p></div>

<p>It is to be assumed that similar communities of Hellenized
Jews were found in the other Greek colonies of Tauris, their
population being constantly swelled by the influx of immigrants
from Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, particularly from
Judeo-Hellenistic Alexandria. Since these communities of the
first Christian century appear to have been well-organized and
to have possessed their own institutions, we are safe in assuming
that they were preceded by a more primitive phase of communal
Jewish life, in the shape of petty settlements and trading
stations, which must have arisen in earlier centuries.</p>

<p>From the first centuries of the Christian era date a number
of tombstones bearing representations of the holy candlestick,
the Menorah. The religious influence of Judaism in Tauris
and in the Azov region is attested by various other indications.
The inscriptions contain several references to "those who
fear God the Most High" (σεβόμενοι θεὸν ὕψιστον), a phrase
applied in the Greco-Roman world to pagans who stand half-way
between polytheism on the one hand and Judaism or
primitive Christianity on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>The Judeo-Hellenistic Diaspora in Tauris, on the northern
shores of the Black Sea, was, like its parent stock in Asia
Minor, the center of a Christian propaganda. Towards the
end of the third century we find in Chersonesus, near Sevastopol,
Christian bishops wielding considerable power. The
exercise of this power was evidently responsible for the
pagan rebellion of which we read in the lives of the Christian
martyrs Basil and Capiton. On the sixth of December of
the year 300 the pagan inhabitants rose in revolt against these
two bishops and their fellow-missionaries, and were joined by
the Jews, whom, it would seem, the zealots of the new faith
had endeavored equally to drag into the bosom of the Church.</p>

<p>The existence of a Jewish settlement in the Bosporan kingdom
was also known to St. Jerome, the famous Church father,
who lived at the end of the fourth century in far-off Palestine.
On the authority of his Jewish teacher he applied verse 20
in Obadiah, "and the captivity of Jerusalem which is in
Sepharad," to the Taurian Bosporus, the remotest corner of the
Jewish Diaspora.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>With the division of the Roman Empire into two halves
the Greco-Judean colonies on the Black Sea were naturally
drawn into the sphere of influence of the eastern part, the
Empire of Byzantium, the capital of which, Constantinople,
was situated on the opposite coast of the Black Sea. Commercial
relations brought the Taurian colony into ever closer
contact with the metropolis of Byzantium, and the Jews vied
with the Greeks in the promotion of trade. The persecutions
of the militant Church of Byzantium under the Emperors
Theodosius II., Zeno, and Justinian, during the fifth and sixth
centuries, drove the Jews from the ancient provinces of the
Empire into the Taurian colonies. In the eighth century the
Jewish population of these colonies was so numerous that the
Byzantine chronicler Theophanes places the Jews in the forefront
of the various groups of the population. "In Phanagoria
and the neighboring region," says Theophanes, "the Jews who
live there are surrounded by many other tribes."</p>

<p>These colonies were frequently visited by Christian missionaries,
who endeavored to convert the native population to their
faith, and incidentally also to win over the Jews. The Patriarchs
of Constantinople were then hopeful of drawing the
people of the Old Testament into the fold of the New. The
Patriarch Photius, of the ninth century, writes thus to the
Bishop of Bosporus (Kerch): "Wert thou also to capture the
Judeans there, securing their obedience unto Christ, I should
welcome with my whole soul the fruits of such beautiful hopes."
The "Judeans," however, not only did not take the bait of the
missionaries, but even managed to spoil their propaganda
among the pagans. The most illustrious of all Byzantine missionaries,
Cyril and Methodius, had frequent occasion to quarrel
with "the Judeans, who blaspheme the Christian faith,"
and the boastful ecclesiastic legend asserts that the holy brothers
"by prayer and eloquence defeated the Judeans [in disputes]
and put them to shame" (about 860).</p>

<p>The struggle between the Christian missionaries and the
Jews during that period had for its object the Khazar nation,
part of whom had embraced Judaism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Kingdom of the Khazars</span></p>

<p>While Byzantium was pressing on the Euxine colonies from
the west, endeavoring to draw them, together with the adjoining
lands of the Slavs, into the sphere of Christian civilization,
a new power from the east, from the Caucasus and the Caspian
region, came rushing along in the same direction. We refer to
the Khazars, or Kazars.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Forming originally a conglomerate
of Finno-Turkish tribes, the warlike Khazars appeared in
the Caucasus during the "migration of nations," and began
to make inroads into the Persian Empire of the Sassanids,
often acting as the tools of Persia's rival, Byzantium. The
great Arabic conquests of the seventh century and the rise
of the powerful Eastern Caliphate checked the movement of the
Khazars towards the East, and turned it westward, to the
shores of the Caspian Sea, the mouths of the Volga and the
Don, the Byzantine colonies on the Black and Azov Seas, and,
in particular, the flourishing region of Tauris. At the mouth
of the Volga, where the mighty river joins the Caspian
Sea, near the present city of Astrakhan, arose the kingdom of
the Khazars with its capital Ityl, the name originally designating
the river Volga. From there the bellicose Khazars
made constant raids upon the Slavonian tribes far and near,
to the very gates of Kiev, forcing them to become their
tributaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Another Khazar center was established in the Crimea,
among Byzantine Greeks and Jews. From the Crimea
the Khazars pressed forward in the direction of Byzantium
and the Balkan Peninsula, constituting a serious menace to the
Roman Empire of the East. As a rule, the Byzantine emperors
concluded alliances with the kings, or khagans, of the Khazars,
checking their unbridled energy by means of concessions and
the payment of tribute. In Constantinople the illusion was
fostered that the Church, and with it Byzantine diplomacy,
were in the end bound to triumph over all the Khazars&mdash;by
converting them to Christianity. With this purpose in view,
missionaries were dispatched from Byzantium, while the local
bishops of Tauris were working zealously to the same end.
But the task proved extremely difficult, for the Greek Church
found itself face to face with a powerful rival in Judaism,
which succeeded in establishing its hold on a part of the
Khazar nation.</p>

<p>While yet in their pagan state, the Khazars were exposed
at one and the same time to the influences of three religions:
Mohammedanism, which pursued its triumphant march from
the Arabic Caliphate; Christianity, which was spreading in
Byzantium, and Judaism, which, headed by the Exilarchs and
Gaons of Babylonia, was centered in the Caliphate, while its
ramifications spread all over the Empire of Byzantium and its
colonies on the Black Sea. The Arabs and the Byzantines
succeeded in converting several groups of the Khazar population
to Islam and Christianity, but the lion's share fell to
Judaism, for it managed to get hold of the royal dynasty and
the ruling classes.</p>

<p>The conversion of the Khazars to Judaism, which took place
about 740, is described circumstantially in the traditions preserved
among the Jews and in the accounts of the medieval
Arabic travelers:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The King, or Khagan, of the Khazars, by the name of Bulan,
had resolved to abandon paganism, but was undecided as to the
religion he should adopt instead. Messengers sent by the Caliph
persuaded him to accept Islam, envoys from Byzantium endeavored
to win him over to Christianity, and representatives of Judaism
championed their own faith. As a result, Bulan arranged a disputation
between the advocates of the three religions, to be
held in his presence, but he failed to carry away any definite
conviction from their arguments and mutual refutations. Thereupon
the King invited first the Christian and then the Mohammedan,
and questioned them separately. On asking the former
which religion he thought was the better of the two, Judaism or
Mohammedanism, he received the reply: Judaism, since it is the
older of the two, and the basis of all religions.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> On asking
the Mohammedan, which religion he preferred, Judaism or Christianity,
he received the same reply in favor of Judaism, with
the same motivation. "If that be the case," Bulan argued in
consequence, "if both the Mohammedan and the Christian acknowledge
the superiority of Judaism to the religion of their antagonist,
I too prefer to adopt the Jewish religion." Bulan accordingly embraced
Judaism, and many of the Khazar nobles followed his
example.</p></div>

<p>According to the Jewish sources, one of Bulan's descendants,
the Khagan Obadiah, was a particularly zealous adherent of
Judaism. He invited&mdash;possibly from Babylonia&mdash;many Jewish
sages to his country, to instruct the converted Khazars in
Bible and Talmud, and he founded synagogues, and established
Divine services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>In the ninth and tenth centuries, the kingdom of the
Khazars, governed by rulers professing the Jewish faith, attained
to outward power and inner prosperity. The accounts
of the Arabic writers of that period throw an interesting light
on the inner life of the Khazars, which was marked by religious
tolerance. The king of the Khazars and the governing classes
professed the Jewish religion. Among the lower classes the
three monotheistic religions were all represented, and in addition
a considerable number of pagans still survived. In spite
of the fact that royalty and nobility professed Judaism, the
principle of religious equality was never violated. The khagan
had under him seven (according to another version, nine)
judges: two for the followers of the Jewish religion, two each
for the Christians and Mohammedans, and one for the pagans&mdash;the
Slavs, the Russians, and other races. Only occasionally
did the Khazar king show signs of intolerance, particularly
when rumors concerning Jewish persecutions in other countries
came to his ears. Thus, on one occasion, about 921, on
being informed that the Mohammedans had destroyed a synagogue
somewhere in the land of Babunj, the Khagan gave
orders to destroy the tower (minaret) of a certain mosque and
to kill the muezzins (the heralds who call to prayer), explaining
his attitude in these words: "I should have destroyed the
mosque itself, had I not feared that not a single synagogue
would be left standing in the lands of the Mohammedans."</p>

<p>In the kingdom of the Khazars, favorably situated as it was
between the Caliphate of Bagdad and the Byzantine Empire,
the Jews evidently played an important economic rôle. During
the ninth and tenth centuries the territory of the Khazars was
traversed by one of the great trade routes which connected the
three parts of the Old World. According to the testimony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Ibn Khordadbeh, an Arabic geographer of the ninth century,
Jewish merchants, who were able to speak the principal Asiatic
and European languages, "traveled from West to East and
from East to West, on sea and by land." The land route led
from Persia and the Caucasus "through the country of the
Slavs, near the capital of the Khazars" (the mouth of the
Volga), by crossing the Sea of Jorjan (the Caspian Sea).
Another Arabic writer, named Ibn Fakih,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who wrote shortly
after 900, testifies that on the route of the "Slav merchants,"
who were trading between the Sea of the Khazars (the Caspian
Sea) and that of Rum (the Byzantine or Black Sea), was
found the Jewish city of Samkers, on the Taman Peninsula,
near the Crimea.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>During this period of prosperity the kingdom of the Khazars
received a considerable Jewish influx from Byzantium, where
the Jews were persecuted by Emperor Basil the Macedonian
(867-886), being forcibly converted to Christianity, while
hundreds of Jewish communities were devastated. The Jewish
emigrants from Byzantium were naturally attracted
towards a land in which Judaism was the religion of the Government
and the Court, though equal toleration was accorded to
all other religions. The well-known Arabic writer Masudi
refers to this Jewish immigration in the following passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The population of the Khazar capital consists of Moslems,
Christians, Jews, and pagans. The king, his court, and all members
of the Khazar tribe profess the Jewish religion, which has
been the dominant faith of the country since the time of the
Caliph Harun ar-Rashid. Many Jews who settled among the
Khazars came from all the cities of the Moslems and the lands
of Rum (Byzantium), the reason being that the king of Rum
persecuted the Jews of his empire in order to force them to adopt
Christianity.... In this way a large number of Jews left the
land of Rum in order to depart to the Khazars.</p></div>

<p>This testimony dates from the year 954. Contemporaneous
with it is the extremely interesting correspondence between
Joseph, the Khagan of the Khazars, and Hasdai Ibn Shaprut,
the Jewish statesman of the Cordova Caliphate in Spain.
Being a high official at the court of Abderrahman III.,
Hasdai maintained diplomatic relations with the emperors of
Byzantium and other rulers of Asia and Europe, and in this
way came to learn of the Khazar kingdom, through the
Persian and Byzantine ambassadors. The news of the existence
of a land somewhere beyond the seas where a Jew sat
on the throne, and Judaism was the religion of the state, filled
Hasdai with joy. Firmly convinced that he had found the clue
to the lost Jewish kingdom of which popular Jewish tradition
had so much to tell, the Jewish statesman at the Moslem court
felt the burning need of getting in touch with the rulers of
Khazaria, and, in case the rumors should prove correct, of
transferring his abode thither and devoting his powers of
statesmanship to his fellow-Jews. Prolonged inquiries elicited
the information that the land of the Khazars lay fifteen days
by sea from Constantinople, that it stood in commercial relations
with Byzantium, that the name of its present ruler was
Joseph, and that the safest means of communicating with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was by way of Hungary, Bulgaria, and Russia. After several
vain attempts to get in touch with the ruler of the Khazars
Hasdai finally succeeded in having an elaborate Hebrew epistle
delivered into the hands of King Joseph (about 955).</p>

<p>In his epistle Hasdai first gives an account of himself and
his position at the court of Cordova, and then proceeds to beg
the King of the Khazars to inform him in detail of the rise and
present status of "the Jewish kingdom," being anxious to find
out "whether there is anywhere a soil and a kingdom where
scattered Israel is not subject and subordinate to others."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Were I to know&mdash;Hasdai continues&mdash;that this is true, I should
renounce my place of honor, abandon my lofty rank, forsake my
family, and wander over mountains and hills, by sea and on
land, until I reached the dwelling-place of my lord and sovereign,
there to behold his greatness and splendor, the seats of
his subjects, the position of his servants, and the tranquillity of
the remnant of Israel.... Having been cast down from our
former glory, and now living in exile, we are powerless to answer
those who constantly say unto us: "Every nation hath its own
kingdom, while you have no trace [of a kingdom] on earth."
But when we received the news about our lord and sovereign,
about the power of his kingdom and the multitude of his hosts,
we were filled with astonishment. We lifted our heads, our
spirit revived, and our hands were strengthened, the kingdom of
my lord serving us as an answer. Would that this rumor might
increase in strength [<i>i. e.</i> be verified], for thereby will our greatness
be enhanced!</p></div>

<p>After long and painful waiting Hasdai received the King's
reply. In it the ruler of the Khazars gives an account of the
heterogeneous composition of his people and the various
religions professed by it. He describes how King Bulan and
his princes embraced the Jewish faith after testing the various
rival creeds, and how zealously it was upheld by the Kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Obadiah, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Hanukkah, Isaac, Zebulun,
Moses (or Manasseh II.), Nissi, Aaron, Menahem, Benjamin,
Aaron (II.), the last being the father of the writer, King
Joseph. The King continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I reside [<i>i. e.</i> my residence is situated] at the mouth of the
river Ityl [Volga]; at the end of the river is found the Sea of
Jorjan [the Caspian Sea]. The beginning of the river is towards
the east, at a distance of a four months' journey. Along the banks
of the river there are many nations living in towns and villages,
in open as well as fortified places. These are their names: Burtas,
Bulgar, Suvar, Arisu, Tzarmis, Venentit, Sever, Slaviun.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Each

Khwarism], up to Jorjan, and all the inhabitants of the sea-shore,

from passing into the Caspian Sea for the purpose of making
their way to the Ishmaelites [Mohammedans]. In the same
manner I keep the enemies on land from approaching the gates
of Bab al-Abwab. Because of this I am at war with them, and
were I to let them pass but once, they would destroy the whole
land of the Ishmaelites as far as Bagdad.... Our eyes are
[turned] to God and to the wise men of Israel who preside
over the academies of Jerusalem and Babylon. We are far away
from Zion, but it has come to our ears that, on account of our
sins, the calculations [concerning the coming of the Messiah]
have become confused, so that we know nothing. May it please
the Lord to act for the sake of His great Name. May the destruction
of His temple, and the cutting off of the holy service, and the
misfortunes that have befallen us, not appear small in His sight.
May the words of the prophet be fulfilled: "And the Lord, whom
ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple" (Mal. iii. 1). We have
nothing in our possession [concerning the coming of the Messiah]
except the prophecy of Daniel. May the God of Israel hasten our
redemption and gather together all our exiled and scattered
[brethren] in my lifetime, in thy lifetime, and in the lifetime
of the whole house of Israel, who love His name.</p></div>

<p>The concluding phrases cast a shadow of doubt on the
authenticity of this epistle or, more correctly, of some parts
of both epistles, which more probably reflect the mournful Messianic
temper of the sixteenth century, when this correspondence
was brought to light by Spanish exiles who had made
their way to Constantinople, than the state of mind of a
Spanish dignitary or a Khazar king of the tenth century.
However, the essential data contained in Joseph's epistle
are so completely in accord with the reports of contemporaneous
Arabic writers that the substance of this correspondence
may be safely declared to be authentic.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Joseph's epistle must have arrived in Spain about 960.
Only a few years later events occurred which made this King
the last ruler of the Khazars. The apprehensions, voiced in
his letter, concerning the Russians, with whom the King was
at war, and who were ready to "destroy the whole land of the
Ishmaelites as far as Bagdad," were speedily realized. A few
years later the Slavonian tribes, who had in the meantime been
united under the leadership of Russian princes, not only threw
off the yoke of the Khazars, whose vassals they were, but also
succeeded in invading and finally destroying their center at the
mouth of the Volga. Prince Svyatoslav of Kiev devastated
the Khazar territories on the Ityl, and, penetrating to the
heart of the country, dislodged the Khazars from the Caspian
region (966-969). The Khazars withdrew to their possessions
on the Black Sea, and established themselves in particular
on the Crimean Peninsula, which for a long time retained
the name of Khazaria.</p>

<p>The greatly reduced Khazar kingdom in Tauris, the survival
of a mighty empire, was able to hold its own for nearly half a
century, until in the eleventh century it fell a prey to the Russians
and Byzantines (1016). The relatives of the last khagan
fled, according to tradition, to their coreligionists in Spain.
The Khazar nation was scattered, and was subsequently lost
among the other nations. The remnants of the Khazars in the
Crimea who professed Judaism were in all likelihood merged
with the native Jews, consisting partly of Rabbanites and
partly of Karaites.</p>

<p>In this way the ancient Jewish settlements on the Crimean
Peninsula suddenly received a large increase. At the same
time the influx of Jewish immigrants, who, together with the
Greeks, moved from Byzantium towards the northern shores of
the Black Sea, continued as theretofore, the greater part of
these immigrants consisting of Karaites, who were found in
large numbers in the Byzantine Empire. Even the subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
dominion of the Pechenegs and Polovtzis, who ruled over the
Tauris region after the downfall of the Khazars, failed to
uproot the ancient traditions, and as late as the twelfth century
the name Khazaria meets us in contemporary documents.
About the year 1175 the traveler Pethahiah of Ratisbon visited
"the land of the Kedars and that of the Khazars, which are
separated from each other by a sea tongue," meaning the continental
part of Tauris, where the nomadic Polovtzis (Kedars)
were roaming about, and the Crimean Peninsula, between
which two regions lie the Gulf of Perekop and the isthmus of
the same name. In the land of the Kedars Pethahiah did not
find genuine Jews, but <i>minim</i>, heretics or sectarians, who
"do not believe in the traditions of the sages, eat their Sabbath
meal in the dark, are ignorant of the Talmudic forms of
the benedictions and prayers, and have not even heard of the
Talmud." It is evident that the author is describing the
Karaites.</p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap">The Jews in the Early Russian Principalities and in
the Tataric Khanate of the Crimea</span><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>With the growth of the Russian Principality of Kiev, which
received its ecclesiastic organization from the hands of Byzantine
monks, it gradually became another objective of Jewish
immigration. The Jews came thither not only from Khazaria,
or the Crimea, but also, following in the wake of the
Greeks, from the Empire of Byzantium, developing the commercial
life of the principality and connecting that primitive
region with the centers of human civilization. The popular
legend, which is reproduced in the ancient Russian chronicles,
and is no doubt tinged with the spirit of Byzantine clericalism,
makes the Jews participate in the competition of religions for
the conquest of pagan Russia, in that famous spectacle of the
"test of creeds" which took place in 986 in the presence of
Vladimir, Prince of Kiev.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The church legend narrates that when Vladimir had announced
his intention to abandon idolatry, he received a visit from Khazarian
Jews, who said to him: "We have heard that the Christians
have come to preach their faith, but they believe in one who was
crucified by us, while we believe in the one God, the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob." Vladimir asked the Jews: "What does
your law prescribe?" To this they replied: "To be circumcised,
not to eat pork or game, and to keep the Sabbath." "Where is your
country?" inquired the Prince. "In Jerusalem," replied the Jews.
"But do you live there?" he asked. "We do not," answered the
Jews, "for the Lord was wroth with our forefathers, and scattered
us all over the earth for our sins, while our land was given away to
the Christians." Thereupon Vladimir exclaimed: "How then
dare you teach others when you yourselves are rejected by God
and scattered? If God loved you, you would not be dispersed in
strange lands. Do you intend to inflict the same misfortune
on me?"</p></div>

<p>This popular tradition is historically true only insofar as it
reflects the ecclesiastic and political struggle of the time. It was
in Taurian Chersonesus, the ancient scene of Jewish and
Byzantine rivalry, that the threads were woven which subsequently
tied pagan Russia to Byzantium. The attempts of
the Taurian, or Khazarian, Jews to assert their claims in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
religious competition at Kiev were bound to prove a failure.
For community of political and economic interests was forcing
Byzantium and the Principality of Kiev into an alliance, which
was finally consummated at the end of the tenth century by
the conversion of Russia to Greek Orthodox Christianity. The
alliance resulted in the downfall of their common enemy, the
Khazars, who, for several centuries, had been struggling with
the Byzantines on the shores of the Black Sea, and at the
same time had held in subjection the tribes of the Slavs. In
consequence of the defeat of the Khazars, a part of the Jewish-Khazarian
center in Tauris was transferred to the Principality
of Kiev.</p>

<p>The coincidence of the settlement of Jews in Kiev with
the conversion of Russia to the Greek Orthodox faith foreshadows
the course of history. The very earliest phase of Russian
cultural life is stamped by the Byzantine spirit of intolerance
in relation to the Jews. The Abbot of the famous
Pechera monastery, Theodosius (1057-1074), taught the Kiovians
to live at peace with friends and foes, "but with their
own foes, not with those of God." God's foes, however, are
Jews and heretics, "who hold a crooked religion." In the
Life of Theodosius written by the celebrated Russian chronicler
Nestor we are told that this austere monk was in the habit
of getting up in the night and secretly going to the Jews to
argue with them about Christ. He would scold them, branding
them as wicked and godless, and would purposely irritate
them, in the hope of being killed "for the profession of
Christ" and thus attaining to martyrdom, though it would
seem that the Jews consistently refused to grant him this
pleasure. Hatred against Jews and Judaism was equally
preached by Theodosius' contemporaries Illarion and John,
Metropolitans of Kiev (about 1050 and 1080).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>This propaganda of religious intolerance did not remain
without effect. In the beginning of the twelfth century the
Jewish colony of Kiev experienced the first pogrom. Under
Grand Duke Svyatopolk II. (1093-1113) the Jews of Kiev
had enjoyed complete liberty of trade and commerce. The
Prince had protected his Jewish subjects, and had intrusted
some of them with the collection of the customs and other ducal
imposts. But during the interregnum following the death of
Svyatopolk (1113) they had to pay dearly for the liberty
enjoyed by them. The Kiovians had offered the throne of
the principality to Vladimir Monomakh, but he was slow about
entering the capital. As a result, riots broke out. The Kiev
mob revolted, and, after looting the residences of several high
officials, threw itself upon the Jews and plundered their property.
The well-intentioned among the inhabitants of Kiev
dispatched a second delegation to Monomakh, warning him
that, if he tarried longer, the riots would assume formidable
dimensions. Thereupon Monomakh arrived and restored order
in the capital.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Jews continued to reside in Kiev. In 1124
they suffered severely from a fire which destroyed a considerable
portion of the city. In the chronicles of that period (1146-1151)
mention is frequently made of the "Jewish gate" in
Kiev. Jewish merchants were attracted towards this city, a
growing commercial center serving as the connecting link
between Western Europe on the one hand and the Black Sea
provinces and the Asiatic continent on the other. Reference
to Kiev is made by the Jewish travelers of the time, Benjamin
of Tudela and Pethahiah of Ratisbon (1160-1190). The
former speaks of "the kingdom of Russia, stretching from the
gates of Prague to the gates of Kiev, a large city on the border<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of the kingdom." The latter, Pethahiah, informs us that, on
leaving his home in Ratisbon, he proceeded to Prague, the
capital of Bohemia; from Prague he went to Poland, and from
there "to Kiev, which is in Russia," whereupon he traveled
for six days, until he reached the Dnieper, and, having crossed
it, finally arrived on the coast of the Black Sea and in the
Crimea.</p>

<p>After the Crusades, when considerable settlements of Jewish
immigrants from Germany began to spring up in Poland,
part of these immigrants found their way into the Principality
of Kiev. The German rabbis of the twelfth century occasionally
refer in their writings to the journeys of German Jews
traveling with their merchandise to "Russ" and "Sclavonia"
(= Slavonia, Slav countries). The Jews of Russia, who lacked
rabbinical authorities of their own, addressed their inquiries to
the Jewish scholars of Germany, or sent their studious young
men to the West to obtain a Talmudic education. Hebrew
sources of the twelfth century make mention of the names of
Rabbi Isaac of Chernigov and Rabbi Moses of Kiev. The
latter is quoted as having addressed an inquiry to the well-known
Gaon of Bagdad, Samuel ben Ali.</p>

<p>The conquest of the Crimea by the Tatar khans in the
thirteenth century and the gradual extension of their sovereignty
to the Principalities of Kiev and Moscow brought the
old center of Judaism in the Tauris region in close contact
with its offshoots in various parts of Russia. Kiev enters into
regular commercial intercourse with Kaffa (Theodosia) on the
Crimean sea-shore. Kaffa becomes during that period an international
emporium, owing to the Genoese, who had obtained
from the Tatar khans concessions for Kaffa and the surrounding
country, and had founded there a commercial colony of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Genoese Republic. The Crimean Peninsula was joined to the
world commerce of Italy, and merchantmen were constantly
ploughing the seas between Genoa and Kaffa, passing through
the Byzantine Dardanelles. Italians, Greeks, Jews, and Armenians
flocked to Kaffa and the adjacent localities on the southern
coast of the Crimea. The Government of the Genoese
Republic time and again instructed its consuls who were
charged with the administration of the Crimean colony to
observe the principles of religious toleration in their attitude
towards this heterogeneous population. If the testimony of
the traveler Schiltberger, who visited the Crimea between
1394 and 1427, may be relied upon, there were in Kaffa Jews
"of two kinds," evidently Rabbanites and Karaites, who had
two synagogues and four thousand houses, an imposing population
to judge by its numbers.</p>

<p>The great crisis in the history of Byzantium&mdash;the capture of
Constantinople by the Turks&mdash;affected also the Genoese colony
in the Crimea. The Turks began to hamper the Genoese in
their navigation through the straits. In 1455 the Genoese
Government ceded its Kaffa possessions to the Bank of St.
George in Genoa. The new administration set out to restore
order in the colony and establish normal relations between the
various races inhabiting it; but the days of this cultural oasis
on the Black Sea were numbered. In 1475 Kaffa was taken
by the Turks, and the whole peninsula fell under Turco-Tataric
dominion.</p>

<p>Important Jewish communities were to be found during that
period also in the older Tataric possessions of the Crimea. Two
Jewish communities, one consisting of Rabbanites and the
other of Karaites, flourished, during the thirteenth century,
in the ancient capital of the Tatar khans, named Solkhat (now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Eski-Krym). Beginning with 1428, the old Karaite community
of Chufut-Kale ("the Rock of the Jews"), situated
near the new Tatar capital, Bakhchi-Sarai, grows in numbers
and influence. The memory of this community is perpetuated
by a huge number of tombstones, ranging from the thirteenth
to the eighteenth century. Crimea, now peopled with Jews,
sends forth settlers to Lithuania, where, at the end of the
fourteenth century, Grand Duke Vitovt<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> takes them under his
protection. Crimean colonies spring up in the Lithuanian
towns of Troki and Lutzk, which, as will be seen later, are
granted extensive privileges by the ruler of the land.</p>

<p>The establishment of Turkish sovereignty over the Crimea
(1475-1783) resulted in a closer commercial relationship between
the Jewish center on the Peninsula and the Principality
of Moscow, which at that time fenced herself off from the outside
world by a Chinese wall, and, with few exceptions, barred
from her dominions all foreigners and infidels, or "Basurmans."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
In the second half of the fifteenth century the Grand
Duke of Muscovy, Ivan III., was constrained to seek the help
of several Crimean Jews in his diplomatic negotiations with
the Khan of the Crimea, Mengli-Guiray. One of the agents of
the Muscovite Prince was an influential Jew of Kaffa, by the
name of Khoza Kokos, who was instrumental in bringing about
a military alliance between the Grand Duke and the Khan
(1472-1475). It is curious to note that Kokos wrote his
letters to Ivan III. in Hebrew, so that the Muscovite ruler,
who evidently could find no one in Moscow familiar with that
language, had to request his agent to correspond with him in
Russian or "in the Basurman language" (Tataric or perhaps
Italian). Another agent of Ivan III., Zechariah Guizolfi,
was an Italian Jew, who had previously occupied an important
post in the Genoese colony in the Crimea, and was the owner of
the Taman Peninsula ("the Prince of Taman"). He stood in
close relations to Khan Mengli-Guiray, and in this capacity
carried on a diplomatic correspondence with the Prince of
Muscovy (1484-1500). Later on Zechariah was on the point
of taking up his abode in Moscow in order to participate more
directly in the foreign affairs of Russia, but circumstances
interfered with the execution of the plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>During the same period there arose in Moscow, as the result
of a secret propaganda of Judaism, a religious movement
known under the name of the "Judaizing heresy." According
to the Russian chroniclers, the originator of this heresy was the
learned Jew Skharia (Zechariah), who had emigrated with a
number of coreligionists from Kiev to the ancient Russian city
of Novgorod. Profiting by the religious unrest rife at that
time in Novgorod&mdash;a new sect, called the Strigolniki,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> had
arisen in the city, which abrogated the Church rites, and went
to the point of denying the divinity of Christ&mdash;Zechariah got
in touch with several representatives of the Orthodox clergy,
and succeeded in converting them to Judaism. The leaders of
the Novgorod apostates, the priests Denis and Alexius, went to
Moscow in 1480, and converted a number of the Greek Orthodox
there, some of the new converts even submitting to the rite
of circumcision. The "Judaizing heresy" was soon intrenched
among the nobility of Moscow and in the court circles.
Among its sympathizers was the daughter-in-law of the Grand
Duke, Helena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>The Archbishop of Novgorod, Hennadius, called attention
to the dangerous propagation of the "Judaizing heresy," and
made valiant efforts to uproot it in his diocese. In Moscow the
fight against the new doctrine proved extremely difficult. But
here too it was finally checked, owing to the vigorous endeavors
of Hennadius and other Orthodox zealots. By the decision of
the Church Council of 1504, supported by the orders of Ivan
III., the principal apostates were burned at the stake, while
the others were cast into prison or exiled to monasteries. As
a result, the "Judaizing heresy" ceased to exist.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Another tragic occurrence in the same period affords a lurid
illustration of Muscovite superstition. At the court of Grand
Duke Ivan III. the post of physician was occupied by a learned
Jew, Master Leon, who had been invited from Venice. In the
beginning of 1490 the eldest son of the Grand Duke fell dangerously
ill. Master Leon tried to cure his patient by means
of hot cupping-glasses and various medicaments. Questioned
by the Grand Duke whether his son had any chances of recovery,
the physician, in an unguarded moment, replied: "I shall
not fail to cure your son; otherwise you may put me to death!"
On March 15, 1490, the patient died. When the forty days of
mourning were over, Ivan III. gave orders to cut off the head
of the Jewish physician for his failure to effect a cure. The
execution was carried out publicly, on one of the squares of
Moscow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>In the eyes of the Muscovites both the learned theologian
Skharia and the physician Leon were adepts of the "black
art," or magicians. The "Judaizing heresy" instilled in them
a superstitious fear of the Jews, of whom they only knew
by hearsay. As long as such ideas and manners prevailed,
the Jews could scarcely expect to be hospitably received in the
land of the Muscovites. No wonder then that for a long time
the Jews appear there, not in the capacity of permanent residents,
but as itinerant merchants, who in a few cases&mdash;and
with extreme reluctance at that&mdash;are accorded the right of
temporary sojourn in "holy Russia."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
THE JEWISH COLONIES IN POLAND AND
LITHUANIA</h2>


<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Immigration from Western Europe during the
Period of the Crusades</span></p>

<p>While the Jewish colonies on the shores of the Black Sea
and on the territory of modern South Russia were due to immigration
from the lands of the Greco-Byzantine and Mohammedan
East, the Jewish settlements in Poland were founded
by new-comers from Western Europe, from the lands of
German culture and "the Latin faith."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This division was a
natural product of the historic development that made Slavonian
Russia gravitate towards the East, and Slavonian
Poland turn towards the West. Even prior to her joining
the ecclesiastic organization of the West, Poland had attained
to prominence as a commercial colony of Germany. The
Slav lands on the banks of the Varta and Vistula, being nearest
to Western Europe, were bound to attract the Jews, at a very
early period, in their capacity as international traders. There
is reason to believe that, as far back as the ninth century, Jews
living in the German provinces of Charlemagne's Empire carried
on commerce with the neighboring Slav countries, and
visited Poland with their merchandise. These ephemeral visits
frequently led to their permanent settlement in those strange
lands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Information concerning the Jews of pre-Christian Poland
has come down to us in the shape of hazy legends. One of
these legends narrates that, after the death of Prince Popiel,
about the middle of the ninth century, the Poles assembled in
Krushvitza, their ancient capital, to choose a successor to the
dead sovereign. After prolonged disputes concerning the
person to be elected, it was finally agreed that the first man
found entering the town the following morning should be
chosen as the ruler. It so happened that on the following
morning the first to enter the town was the Jew Abraham
Prokhovnik.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He was seized and proclaimed prince, but he
declined the honor, urging that it be accorded to a wise Pole
by the name of Piast, who thus became the progenitor of the
Piast dynasty.</p>

<p>Another legend has it that at the end of the ninth century
a Jewish delegation from Germany waited upon the Polish
Prince Leshek, to plead for the admission of Jews into Poland.
Leshek subjected the delegates to a protracted cross-examination
concerning the principles of the Jewish religion and Jewish
morality, and finally complied with their request. Thereupon
large numbers of German Jews began to arrive in Poland,
and, in 905, they obtained special written privileges, which,
according to the same legend, were subsequently lost. These
obscure tales, though lacking all foundation in fact, and
undoubtedly invented in much later times, contain a grain
of historic truth, in that they indicate the existence of Jewish
settlements in pagan Poland, and point to their German origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>The propagation of Latin Christianity in Poland (beginning
with 966), which placed the country under the control not only
of the emperors of Germany but also of its bishops as the
representatives of the Roman See, was bound to stimulate the
intercourse between the two countries and result in an increased
influx of Jewish merchants and settlers. However,
this slow commercial colonization would scarcely have assumed
any considerable dimensions, had not exceptional circumstances
forced a large number of Jews to seek refuge in Poland.
A compulsory immigration of this kind began after the first
Crusade, in 1096. It started in near-by Slavonian Bohemia,
where the Crusaders attacked the Jews of Prague, and converted
them forcibly to Christianity. The Bohemian Jews
made up their minds to flee to neighboring Poland, which
had not yet been reached by the devastating Christian hosts.
The Bohemian Prince Vratislav robbed the immigrants on the
way, but even this could not prevent many of them from leaving
the country in which both people and Government were hostile
to them (1098).</p>

<p>Beginning with this period there was a steady flow of Jews
from the Rhine and Danube provinces into Poland, increasing
in volume as a result of the Crusades (1146-1147 and 1196)
and the severe Jewish persecutions in Germany. The accentuation
of Jewish suffering in Germany during the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, when the royal power was incapable of
shielding its <i>Kammerknechte</i> against the fury of the fanatical
mob or the degrading canons of the Church, drove vast numbers
of Jews into Poland. Here the refugees sought shelter in
the provinces nearest to the Austro-German border, Cracow,
Posen, Kalish, and Silesia.</p>

<p>The first signs of discord between Christians and Jews are
to be noticed in the second half of the twelfth century, when
Poland fell asunder into several feudal Principalities, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
"Appanages."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The Prince of Great Poland, Mechislav III.,
the Old, in his desire to enforce law and order, found it necessary
to issue, in 1173, strict injunctions forbidding all kinds of
violence against the Jews and in particular the attacks upon
them by Christian "scholars," the pupils of the ecclesiastic
and monastic colleges. Those found guilty of such attacks were
to be heavily fined. On the whole, the rulers were willing to
take the Jews under their protection. Under Mechislav the
Old, Casimir the Just, and Leshek the White, who reigned
at the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth
century, the Jews farmed and administered the mint of Great
and of Little Poland. On the coins struck by these Jews, many
of which have come down to us, the names of the ruling princes
are marked in Hebrew characters.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> At the very beginning of
the thirteenth century (1203-1207) we hear of Jews owning
lands and estates in Polish Silesia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>Such was the rise and growth of the Jewish colonies in
Poland. As time went on, the commercial intercourse between
these colonies and the West led to a spiritual relationship between
them and the centers of Jewish culture in Europe. A
contemporary Bohemian scholar of the Tosafist school, Rabbi
Eliezer, informs us that the Jews of Poland, Russia, and Hungary,
having no scholars of their own, invited their spiritual
leaders from other countries, probably from Germany. These
foreign scholars occupied the posts of rabbis, cantors, and
school teachers among them, and were remunerated for their
services. At the same time studious Polish Jews were in the
habit of going abroad to perfect themselves in the sciences, as
was also the case with the Jewish settlers in Russia. From the
German mother country the Polish Jews received not only
their language, a German dialect, which subsequently developed
into the Polish-Jewish jargon, or Yiddish, but also their
religious culture and their communal organization. All this,
however, was in an embryonic stage, and only gradually unfolded
in the following period.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Charter of Prince Boleslav and the Canons of
the Church</span></p>

<p>The importance of Jewish immigration for the economic
development of Poland was first realized by the feudal
Polish princes of the thirteenth century. Prompted by the
desire of cultivating industrial activities in their dominions,
these princes gladly welcomed settlers from Germany, without
making a distinction between Jews and Christians. Nor
did the native Slav population suffer inconvenience from
this immigration, which, on the contrary, brought the first
elements of a higher civilization into the country. In a land
which had not yet emerged from the primitive stage of agricultural
economy, and possessed only two fixed classes, owners
of the soil and tillers of the soil, the Jews naturally represented
the "third estate," acting as the pioneers of trade and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
finance. They put their capital in circulation, by launching
industrial undertakings, by leasing estates, and farming
various articles of revenue (salt mines, customs duties), and
by engaging in money-lending. The native population, which
medieval culture, with its religious intolerance and class prejudice,
had not yet had time to "train" properly, lived at
peace with the Jews.</p>

<p>The influence of the Church, on the one hand, and that of
adjacent Christian Germany, on the other, slowly undermined
this patriarchal order of things. The popes dispatched their
legates to Poland to see to it that the well-known canonical
statutes, which were permeated with implacable hatred against
the adherents of Judaism, did not remain a dead letter, but
were carried out in practice. During the same period the
Polish princes, in particular Boleslav the Shy (1247-1279),
endeavored to draw German emigrants into Poland, by bestowing
upon them considerable privileges and the right of
self-government, the so-called "Magdeburg Law," or <i>ius teutonicum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
The Germans, while settling in the Polish cities as
merchants and tradesmen,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and thus becoming the competitors
of the Jews, imported from their native land into the new
environment the spirit of economic class strife and denominational
antagonism. The best of the Polish rulers were forced
to combat the effects of this foreign importation, and found it
necessary to encourage the economic activity of the Jews for
the benefit of the country and to shield them against the insults
of their Christian neighbors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Boleslav of Kalish, surnamed the Pious, who ruled over the
territory of Great Poland, was a prince of this kind. In 1264,
with the consent of the highest dignitaries of the state, he promulgated
a statute defining the rights of the Jews within his
dominions. This charter of privileges, closely resembling in
its contents the statutes of Frederick of Austria and Ottocar of
Bohemia, became the corner-stone of Polish-Jewish legislation.
Boleslav's charter consists of thirty-seven paragraphs, and
begins with these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The deeds of man, when unconfirmed by the voice of witnesses
or by written documents, are bound to pass away swiftly and disappear
from memory. Because of this, we, Boleslav, Prince of
Great Poland, make it known to our contemporaries as well as to
our descendants, to whom this writing shall come down, that the
Jews, who have established themselves over the length and breadth
of our country, have received from us the following statutes and
privileges.</p></div>

<p>The first clause of the charter prescribes that, when civil and
criminal cases are tried in court, the testimony of a Christian
against a Jew is to be accepted only if confirmed by the deposition
of a Jewish witness. The following clauses (§§2-7)
determine the process of law in litigation between Christians
and Jews, involving primarily pawnbroking; the rules prescribed
there protect equally the interests of the Jewish creditor
and the Christian debtor. Lawsuits between Jew and Jew
do not fall within the jurisdiction of the general municipal
courts, but are tried either by the prince himself or by his lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
lieutenant, the voyevoda<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, or the special judge appointed by the
latter (§8). The Christian who has murdered or wounded
a Jew answers for his crime before the princely court: in
the former case the culprit incurs "due punishment," and his
property is forfeit to the prince; in the latter case he has
to satisfy the plaintiff, and must in addition pay a fine into the
princely exchequer (§§9-10).</p>

<p>This is followed by a set of paragraphs which guarantee to
the Jew the inviolability of his person and property. They
forbid annoying Jewish merchants on the road, exacting from
them higher customs duties than from Christians, demolishing
Jewish cemeteries, and attacking synagogues or "schools"
(§§12-15). In case of a nocturnal assault upon the home
of a Jew, the Christian neighbors are obliged to come to his
rescue as soon as they hear his cries; those who fail to respond
are subject to a fine (§36).</p>

<p>The rights and functions of the "Jewish judge,"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> who is
appointed to try cases between Jew and Jew, sitting "in the
neighborhood of the synagogue or in some other place," are set
forth elaborately (§§16-23). The kidnaping of Jewish children
with the view of baptizing them is severely punished (§27).
The charter further prohibits charging the Jews with the use of
Christian blood for ritual purposes, in view of the fact that
the groundlessness of such charges had been demonstrated
by papal bulls. Should nevertheless such charges be raised, they
must be corroborated by six witnesses, three Christians and
three Jews. If the charges are substantiated, the guilty Jew
loses his life; otherwise the same fate overtakes the Christian
informer (§32). All these legal safeguards were, in the words
of the charter, to remain in force "for all time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The Polish lawgiver was evidently anxious to secure for the
Jews such conditions of life as might enable them to benefit the
country by their commercial activity, while enjoying liberty of
conscience and living in harmony with the non-Jewish population.
Boleslav's enactment expresses, not the individual will
of the ruler, but the collective decision of the highest dignitaries
and the representatives of the estates, who, as is pointed
out in the document, had been previously consulted.</p>

<p>Thus the temporal powers of the state, guided by the economic
needs of the country, endeavored to establish Jewish
life in Poland on more or less rational civic foundations. The
ecclesiastic authorities, however, inspired rather by the cosmopolitan
ideals of the Roman Church than by love of their
native land, strained all their energies to detach the Jews from
the general life of the country. They segregated them from
the Christian population because of their alleged injuriousness
to the Catholic faith, and reduced them to the position of a
despised caste. The well-known Church Council of Breslau,
convened in 1266 by the Papal Legate Guido, had the special
mission of introducing in the oldest Polish diocese, that of
Gnesen, the canonical laws, including those applying to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Jews. The motives by which this legislation was prompted
are frankly stated in the preamble to the section of the Breslau
"constitution" which deals with the Jews:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In view of the fact&mdash;runs clause 12&mdash;that Poland is a new plantation
on the soil of Christianity (<i>quum adhuc terra Polonica sit in
corpore Christianitatis nova plantatio</i>), there is reason to fear
that her Christian population will fall an easy prey to the influence
of the superstitions and evil habits of the Jews living
among them, the more so as the Christian religion took root
in the hearts of the faithful of these countries at a later date
and in a more feeble manner. For this reason we most strictly
enjoin that the Jews residing in the diocese of Gnesen shall
not live side by side with the Christians, but shall live apart,
in houses adjoining each other or connected with one another,
in some section of the city or village. The section inhabited by
Jews shall be separated from the general dwelling-place of the
Christians by a hedge, wall, or ditch.</p></div>

<p>The Jews owning houses in the Christian quarter shall be
compelled to sell them within the shortest term possible.</p>

<p>Further injunctions prescribe that the Jews shall lock themselves
up in their houses while church processions are marching
through the streets; that in each city they shall possess no more
than one synagogue; that, "in order to be marked off from the
Christians," they shall wear a peculiarly shaped hat, with a
horn-like shield (<i>cornutum pileum</i>), and that any Jew showing
himself on the street without this headgear shall be subject
to punishment, in accordance with the custom of the country.</p>

<p>The Christians are forbidden, under penalty of excommunication,
to invite Jews to a meal, or to eat and drink with them,
or dance and make merry with them at weddings and other
celebrations. The Christians are barred from buying meat
and other eatables from Jews, since the sellers might treacherously
put poison in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>These prohibitions are followed by the ancient canonical
enactments forbidding the Jews to keep Christian servants,
nursery-maids, and wet-nurses, and barring them from collecting
customs duties and exercising any other public function. A
Jew living unlawfully with a Christian woman is liable to imprisonment
and fine, while the woman is subject to a public
whipping and to banishment from the town for all time.</p>

<p>The Church Council which held its sessions in Buda (Ofen),
in Hungary, in 1279, was attended by the highest ecclesiastic
dignitaries of Poland. This Council ratified the clause concerning
the "Jewish sign," supplementing it by the following
details: The Jews of both sexes shall be obliged to
wear a ring of red cloth sewed on to their upper garment,
on the left side of the chest. The Jew appearing on the
street without this sign shall be accounted a vagrant, and no
Christian shall have the right to do business with him. A
similar sign, only of saffron color, is prescribed for "Saracens
and Ishmaelites," <i>i. e.</i> for Mohammedans. The law barring
Jews from the collection of customs and the discharge of other
public functions is extended by the Synod of Buda to the
"sectarians," to the Christians of the Greek Orthodox persuasion.</p>

<p>In this manner the condition of the Jews of Poland in the
thirteenth century was determined by two factors operating
in different directions: the temporal powers, actuated by
economic considerations, accorded the Jews the elementary
rights of citizenship, while the ecclesiastic powers, prompted by
religious intolerance, endeavored to exclude the Jews from
civil life. As long as patriarchal conditions of life prevailed,
and Catholicism in Poland had not yet assumed complete
control over the country, the policy of the Church was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
powerless to inflict serious damage upon the Jews. They
lived in safety, under the protection of the Polish princes, and,
except for the German immigrants, managed to get along
peaceably with the Christian population. But the clerical
party was looking out for the future, taking assiduous care that
"the new plantation on the soil of Christianity" should develop
along the lines of the older plantations, and was scattering
the seeds of religious hatred in the patient expectation of a
plentiful harvest.</p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap">Rise of Polish Jewry under Casimir the Great</span></p>

<p>The Jewish emigration from Western Europe assumed especially
large proportions in the first part of the fourteenth
century. The butcheries perpetrated by the hordes of Rindfleisch
and Armleder, and the massacres accompanying the
Black Death, forced a large number of German Jews to seek
shelter in Poland, which was then undergoing the process of
unification and rejuvenation. In 1319, King Vladislav<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Lokietek<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> laid the foundation for the political unity of Poland
by abolishing the former feudal divisions, and his famous son
Casimir the Great (1333-1370) was indefatigable in his endeavors
to raise the level of civil and economic life in his
united realm. Casimir the Great founded new cities and
fortified old ones, promoted commerce and industry, and protected,
with equal solicitude, the interests of all classes, not
excluding those of the peasants. He was styled the "peasant
king," and the popular commendation of his efforts in the
upbuilding of the cities was crystallized in the saying that
Casimir the Great "found a Poland of wood and left behind
him a Poland of stone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>A ruler of this type could not but welcome the useful industrial
activity of the Jews with the liveliest satisfaction. He was
anxious to bring them in close contact with the Christian
population on the common ground of peaceful labor and
mutual helpfulness. He was equally quick to appreciate the
advantages which the none too flourishing royal exchequer
might derive from the experience of Jewish capitalists. Such
must have been the motives which actuated Casimir when, in
the second year of his reign (1344), he ratified, in Cracow,
the charter which Boleslav of Kalish had granted to the Jews of
Great Poland, and which he now extended in its operation to
all the provinces of the kingdom.</p>

<p>On later occasions (1346-1370) Casimir amplified the charter
of Boleslav by adding new enactments. In view of the hostility
of the municipalities and the clergy towards the Jews,
the King found it necessary to insist in particular on placing
Jewish legal cases under his own jurisdiction, and taking them
out of the hands of the municipal and ecclesiastic authorities.
The Jews were granted the following privileges: the right of
free transit through the whole country, of residing in the
cities, towns, and villages, of renting and mortgaging the
estates of the nobility, and lending money at a fixed rate of
interest, the last pursuit being closed to Christians by virtue
of canonical restrictions, and therefore left entirely in the
hands of the Jews. The Polish lawgiver was equally solicitous
about enforcing respect for the Jew as a human being and
drawing him nearer to the Christian in private life, in violent
contradiction with the tendency of the Church to isolate the
infidels from the "flock of the faithful." "If the Jew," runs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
one of the clauses of Casimir's charter, "enters the house of
a Christian, no one has a right to cause him any injury or unpleasantness.
Every Jew is allowed to visit the municipal
baths in safety, in the same way as the Christians,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and pay
the same fee as the Christians."</p>

<p>Casimir was equally interested in ordering the inner life of
the Jews. The "Jewish judge," a Christian official appointed
by the king to try Jewish cases, was enjoined to dispense justice
in the synagogue or some other place, in accordance with
the wishes of the representatives of the Jewish community. The
rôle of process-server was assigned to the "schoolman," <i>i. e.</i>
the synagogue beadle. This was the germ of the future system
of Kahal autonomy.</p>

<p>It seems that in the fateful year of the Black Death (1348-1349)
the Polish Jews too were in great danger. On the wings
of the plague, which penetrated from Germany to Poland,
came the hideous rumor charging the Jews with having
poisoned the wells. If we are to trust the testimony of an
Italian chronicler, Matteo Villani, some ten thousand Jews
in the Polish cities bordering on Germany met their fate in
1348 at the hands of Christian mobs, even the King being
powerless to shield the unfortunates against the fury of the
people. A vague account in an old Polish chronicle relates
that in the year 1349 the Jews were exterminated "in nearly
the whole of Poland." It is possible that attacks on the Jews
took place in the border towns, but, judging by the fact that
the Jewish chroniclers, in describing the ravages of the Black
Death, make no mention of Poland, these attacks cannot have
been extensive. Be this as it may, there can be no doubt that,
threatened with massacres in Germany, large numbers of Jews
fled to the neighboring towns of Poland, and subsequently
settled there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>It may be mentioned in this connection that from about the
same time dates the origin of the Jewish community of Lvov
(Lemberg),<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the capital of Red Russia, or Galicia, which had
been added to his dominions by Casimir the Great.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In 1356
Casimir, in granting the Magdeburg Law to the city of Lemberg,
bestowed upon the local Jews the right "of being judged
according to their own laws," <i>i. e.</i> autonomy in their communal
affairs, a privilege accorded at the same time to the Ruthenians,
Armenians, and Tatars.</p>

<p>Casimir the Great's attitude towards the Jews was thus a
part of his general policy with reference to foreign settlers,
whom he believed to be useful for the development of the
country. This, however, did not prevent certain evil-minded
persons, both then and in later ages, from seeing in these acts
of rational statesmanship the manifestation of the King's personal
predilections and attachments. Rumor had it that Casimir
was favorably disposed towards the Jews because of his infatuation
with the beautiful Jewess Estherka. This Jewish
belle, the daughter of a tailor, is supposed to have captured the
heart of the King so completely that in 1356 he abandoned a
former favorite for her sake. Estherka lived in the royal palace
of Lobzovo, near Cracow. She bore the King two daughters,
who were brought up by their mother in the Jewish religion,
and two sons, who were educated as Christians, and who subsequently
became the progenitors of several noble families.
Estherka was killed during the persecution to which the Jews
were subjected by Casimir's successor, Louis of Hungary. The
whole romantic episode presents a mixture of fact and fiction
in which it is difficult to make out the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly blurred reports have come down to us concerning
the persecutions by the new ruler, Louis of Hungary (1370-1382).
During the reign of this King, when, as the Polish
historians put it, justice had vanished, the law kept silent, and
the people complained bitterly about the despotism of the
judges and officials, an attempt was made to rob the Jews
of the protection of the law. Nursed as he was in the Catholic
traditions of Western Europe, Louis persecuted the Jews
from religious motives, threatening with expulsion those
among them who had refused to embrace the Christian faith.
Fortunately for the Jews his reign in Poland was too ephemeral
and unpopular to undo the work of his famous predecessor, the
last king of the Piast dynasty. Only at a later date, during the
protracted reign of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Yaghello,
who acquired the Polish crown by marrying, in 1386, Louis'
daughter Yadviga, did the Church obtain power over the
affairs of the state, gradually undermining the civil status of
the Jews of Poland.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Polish Jewry During the Reign of Yaghello</span></p>

<p>With the outgoing fourteenth century, Poland was drawn
more and more into the whirlpool of European politics. Catholicism
served as the connecting link between this Slav country
and Western Europe. Hence the influence of the West manifested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
itself primarily in the enhancement of ecclesiastic
authority, which, being cosmopolitan in character, endeavored
to obliterate all national and cultural distinctions. The
Polish king Vladislav Yaghello (1386-1434), having been
converted from paganism to Catholicism, and having forced
his Lithuanian subjects to follow his example, adhered to the
new faith with the ardor of a convert, and frequently yielded
to the influence of the clergy. It was during his reign that the
Jews of Poland suffered their first religious persecution in that
country.</p>

<p>The Jews of Posen were charged with having bribed a poor
Christian woman into stealing from the local Dominican
church three hosts, which supposedly were stabbed and
thrown into a pit. From the pierced hosts, so the superstitious
rumor had it, blood spurted forth, in confirmation
of the Eucharist dogma. Nor was this the only miracle which
popular imagination ascribed to the three bits of holy bread.
The Archbishop of Posen, having learned of the alleged blasphemy,
instituted proceedings against the Jews. The Rabbi
of Posen, thirteen elders of the Jewish community, and the
woman charged with the theft of the holy wafers, became the
victims of popular superstition; after prolonged tortures they
were all tied to pillars, and roasted alive on a slow fire (1399).
Moreover, the Jews of Posen were punished by the imposition
of an "eternal" fine, which they had to pay annually in favor
of the Dominican church. This fine was rigorously exacted
down to the eighteenth century, as long as the legend of the
three hosts lingered in the memory of pious Catholics.</p>

<p>As in the West, religious motives in such cases merely served
as a disguise to cover up motives of an economic nature&mdash;envy
on the part of the Christian city-dwellers of the prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of the Jews, who had managed to obtain a foothold in
certain branches of commerce, and eagerness to dispose in one
way or another of inconvenient rivals. Similar motives,
coupled with religious intolerance, were responsible for the
anti-Jewish riots in Cracow in 1407. In that ancient capital
of Poland the Jews had increased in numbers in the beginning
of the fourteenth century, and, by their commercial enterprise,
had attained to prosperity. The Cracow burghers were
jealous of them, and the clergy found it improper that the
doomed sons of the Synagogue should live so tranquilly under
the shelter of the benevolent Church. A silent but stubborn
agitation was carried on against the Jews, their enemies merely
waiting for a convenient opportunity to square accounts with
them.</p>

<p>On one occasion, on the third day of Easter, the priest
Budek, who had gained the reputation of an implacable Jew-baiter,
delivered a sermon in the Church of St. Barbara. As
he was about to leave the pulpit, he suddenly announced to
the worshipers that he had found a notice on the pulpit to this
effect: "The Jews living in Cracow killed a Christian boy
last night, and made sport over his blood; moreover, they threw
stones at a priest who was going to visit a sick man, and was
carrying a crucifix in his hands." No sooner had these words
been uttered than the people rushed into the Jewish street, and
began to loot the houses of "Christ's enemies." The royal
authorities hastened to the rescue of the Jews, and by armed
force put an end to the riots. But several hours later, when
the bells of the town hall began to ring, summoning the
members of the magistracy to a meeting, for the purpose
of punishing the instigators of the disorders, some one in the
crowd shouted that the magistracy was inviting the Christians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to another attack upon the Jews. Thereupon the
rabble came running from all parts of the city and began to
slay and plunder the Jews, setting fire to their houses. Some
Jews sought refuge in the Tower of St. Anne, but the mob set
fire to the tower, and the unfortunate Jews had to surrender.
A number of them, to save their lives, adopted Christianity,
while the children of the slain were all baptized. Many
Christians, according to the testimony of the Polish historian
Dlugosh<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, grew rich on the money plundered from the Jews.</p>

<p>One cannot fail to perceive in all these catastrophes the
influence of neighboring Germany<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. It was from Germany
that the clerical reaction which followed upon the struggle of
the Church with the reformatory Huss movement penetrated
to Poland. The Synod of Constance, which condemned Huss,
was attended by the Archbishop of Gnesen, Nicholas Tromba,
who appeared at the head of a Polish delegation. On his
return, this leading dignitary of the Polish Church presided
over the proceedings of the Synod of Kalish (1420), which
had also been convened in connection with the Huss movement.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of this Archbishop, the Council of Kalish
solemnly ratified all the anti-Jewish enactments which had
been passed by the Councils of Breslau and Buda (Ofen),<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> but
had seldom been carried out in practice. These laws, as will
be remembered, forbade all intercourse between Jew and
Christian, and ordered the Jews to live in separate quarters, to
wear a distinctive mark on the upper garment, and so forth.
At the same time the Jews were required to pay a tax in favor
of the churches of those diocesan districts "where they now
live, and where by right Christians ought to live," this tax
to correspond to "the losses inflicted by them upon the Christians."
These injunctions were issued as special instructions
to the members of the clergy in all the dioceses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The ecclesiastic tendencies gradually forced their way into
secular legislation. The fanatics of the Church exerted their
influence not only on the King but also on the landed nobility,
the <i>Shlakhta</i>,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> which at that time began to take a more active
interest in the affairs of the state. At the convention of the
Shlakhta in Varta<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> (1423) King Vladislav Yaghello sanctioned
a law forbidding the Jews to lend money against written
securities, only loans against pledges being permitted. The
ecclesiastic origin of this enactment is betrayed in the ugly
manner in which the law is justified in the preamble: "Whereas
Jewish cunning is always directed against the Christians
and aims rather at the property of the Christian than at his
creed or person...."</p>


<p>5. <span class="smcap">The Jews of Lithuania during the Reign of Vitovt</span></p>

<p>An entirely different picture is presented at that time by
Lithuania, which, in spite of its dynastic alliance with Poland,
retained complete autonomy of administration. The patriarchal
order of things, which was nearing its end in Poland,
was still firmly intrenched in the Duchy of Lithuania, but
recently emerged from the stage of primitive paganism.
Medieval culture had not yet taken hold of the inhabitants of
the wooded banks of the Niemen, and the Jews were able to
settle there without having to face violence and persecution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult to determine the exact date of the first Jewish
settlements in Lithuania. So much is certain, however, that by
the end of the fourteenth century a number of important communities
were in existence, such as those of Brest, Grodno,
Troki, Lutzk, and Vladimir, the last two in Volhynia, which,
prior to the Polish-Lithuanian Union of 1579, formed part of
the Duchy. The first one to legalize the existence of these
communities was the Lithuanian Grand Duke Vitovt, who
ruled over Lithuania from 1388 to 1430, partly as an independent
sovereign, partly in the name of his cousin, the Polish
King Yaghello. In 1388 the Jews of Brest and other Lithuanian
communities obtained from Vitovt a charter similar in
content to the statutes of Boleslav of Kalish and Casimir the
Great, and in 1389 even more extensive privileges were bestowed
by him on the Jews of Grodno.</p>

<p>In these enactments the Lithuanian ruler exhibits, like
Casimir, an enlightened solicitude for a peaceful relationship
between Jews and Christians and for the inner welfare of the
Jewish communities. Under the laws enacted by Vitovt the
Jews of Lithuania formed a class of free citizens, standing
under the immediate protection of the Grand Duke and
his local administration. They lived in independent communities,
enjoying autonomy in their internal affairs as far
as religion and property are concerned, while in criminal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
affairs they were liable to the court of the local starosta<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> or sub-starosta,
and, in particularly important cases, to the court of
the Grand Duke himself. The law guaranteed to the Jews inviolability
of person and property, liberty of religion, the right
of free transit, the free pursuit of commerce and trade, on
equal terms with the Christians. The Lithuanian Jews carried
on business on the market-places or in shops, they plied all
kinds of trades, and occasionally engaged in agriculture. Men
of wealth lent money on interest, leased from the Grand Duke
the customs duties, the revenues on spirits, and other taxes.
They held estates either in their own right or in the form of
land leases. The taxes which they paid into the exchequer
were adapted to the character of their occupations, and on the
whole were not burdensome. Aside from the Rabbanite Jews
there existed in Lithuania Karaites, who had immigrated from
the Crimea, and had established themselves in the regions of
Troki and Lutzk.</p>

<p>Accordingly the position of the Jews was more favorable in
Lithuania than in Poland. Jewish immigrants, on their way
from Germany to Poland, frequently went as far as Lithuania
and settled there permanently. Lithuania formed the
extreme boundary in the eastward movement of the Jews, Russia
and Muscovy being almost entirely closed to them.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>6. <span class="smcap">The Conflict between Royalty and Clergy under
Casimir IV. and His Sons</span></p>

<p>The conflict of tendencies in the Polish legislation concerning
the Jews manifested itself with particular violence in the
reign of Casimir IV., the third king of the Yaghello dynasty.
The attitude of Casimir IV. (1447-1492), who was imbued
with the ideas of the humanistic movement then in vogue, was
at first that of a wise ruler, the guardian of the common interests
of his subjects. As Grand Duke of Lithuania he had followed
the liberal Jewish policies of his predecessor Vitovt. He
protected the personal and communal rights of both the Rabbanite
and Karaite Jews&mdash;to the latter he granted, in 1441,
the Magdeburg Law&mdash;and he frequently availed himself of
the services of enterprising Jewish financiers and tax-farmers
to increase the revenues of the state.</p>

<p>Having accepted the Polish crown, Casimir was resolved to
rule independently and to disregard the designs of the all-powerful
clergy. Shortly after his coronation, in August, 1447,
while the King was on a visit to Posen, the city was devastated
by a terrible fire. During the conflagration the ancient original
of the charter which Casimir the Great had bestowed upon the
Jews was lost. A Jewish delegation from the communities of
Posen, Kalish, and other cities petitioned the King to restore
and ratify the old Jewish privileges, on the basis of copies of
the charter which had been spared. Casimir readily granted
the request of the deputies. "We desire"&mdash;he announces in
his new charter&mdash;"that the Jews, whom we wish to protect in
our own interest as well as in the interest of the royal exchequer,
should feel comforted in our beneficent reign." Corroborating
as it did all the rights and privileges previously
conferred upon the Jews&mdash;liberty of residence and commerce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
communal and judicial autonomy, inviolability of life and
liberty, protection against groundless charges and attacks&mdash;the
charter of Casimir IV. was a direct protest against the
canonical laws only recently reissued for Poland by the Council
of Kalish, and for the whole Catholic world by the great Council
at Basle. In opposition to the main trend of the Council resolutions,
the royal charter permitted the Jews to associate with
Christians, and exempted them from the jurisdiction of the
ecclesiastic law courts (1453).</p>

<p>The King's liberalism aroused the resentment of the Catholic
clergy. The leader of the clerical party was the energetic
Archbishop of Cracow, Cardinal Zbignyev Oleshnitzki, who
openly headed the forces arrayed in opposition to the King.
He denounced Casimir bitterly for granting protection to the
Jews, "to the injury and insult of the holy faith."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Do not imagine&mdash;Oleshnitzki writes to the King in May, 1454&mdash;that
in matters touching the Christian religion you are at liberty
to pass any law you please. No one is great and strong enough
to put down all opposition to himself when the interests of the
faith are at stake. I therefore beg and implore your Royal
Majesty to revoke the aforementioned privileges and liberties.
Prove that you are a Catholic sovereign, and remove all occasion
for disgracing your name and for worse offenses that are likely to
follow.</p></div>

<p>In his letter Oleshnitzki refers to the well-known agitator
and Jew-baiter, the Papal Legate Capistrano, who had come to
Poland from Germany in the fall of 1453. With this "scourge
of the Jews" as his ally Oleshnitzki started a campaign against
Jews and heretics (or Hussites). On his arrival in Cracow
Capistrano delivered on the market-place incendiary speeches
against the Jews, and demanded of the King persistently to
revoke the "godless" Jewish privileges, threatening him, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
case of disobedience, with the tortures of hell and terrible misfortunes
for the country.</p>

<p>At first the King refused to yield, but the march of events
favored the anti-Jewish forces. Poland was at war with the
Teutonic Order.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The first defeat sustained by the Polish
troops in this war (September, 1454) gave the clergy an opportunity
of proclaiming that the Lord was chastising the country
for the King's disregard of Church interests and for his protection
of the Jews. At last the King was forced to listen to the
demands of the united clergy and nobility. In November, 1454,
the Statute of Nyeshava<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> was promulgated, and by one of its
clauses all former Jewish privileges were rescinded as "being
equally opposed to Divine right and earthly laws." The reasons
for the enactment, which were evidently dictated by
Oleshnitzki, were formulated as follows: "For it is not meet
that infidels should enjoy greater advantages than the worshipers
of our Lord Christ, and slaves should have no right
to occupy a better position than sons." The Varta Statutes
of 1423 and the former canonical laws were declared in force
again. Clericalism had scored a triumph.</p>

<p>This anti-Jewish tendency communicated itself to the people
at large. In several towns the Jews were attacked. In 1463
detachments of Polish volunteers who were preparing for a
crusade against the Turks passed through Lemberg and Cracow
on their way to Hungary. The disorderly crowd, consisting
of monks, students, peasants, and impoverished noblemen,
threw itself on the Jews of Cracow on the third day of Easter,
looted their houses, and killed about thirty people. When
Casimir IV. learned what had happened, he imposed a fine
on the magistracy for having failed to forestall the riots. Similar
disorders were taking place about the same time in Lemberg,
Posen, and other cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>As far as Casimir IV. was concerned, the clerical policy, artificially
foisted upon him, did not alter his personal readiness
to shield the Jews. But under his sons, the Polish King John
Albrecht and the Lithuanian Grand Duke Alexander Yaghello,
the anti-Jewish policy gained the upper hand. The former
ratified, at the Piotrkov Diet of 1496, the Nyeshava Statute
with its anti-Jewish restrictions. John Albrecht is also
credited with the establishment of the first ghetto in Poland.
In 1494 a large part of the Polish capital of Cracow was destroyed
by fire, and the mob, taking advantage of the prevailing
panic, plundered the property of the Jews. As a result, the
Jews, who at that time were scattered over various parts of the
city, were ordered by the King to move to Kazimiezh,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> a
suburb of Cracow, and to live there apart from the Christians.
Kazimiezh became, in consequence, a wholly Jewish town,
leading throughout the centuries a life of its own, and connected
with the outside world by mere threads of economic
relationship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
While the throne of Poland was occupied by John Albrecht,
his brother Alexander ruled over Lithuania as grand duke.
At first Alexander's attitude towards the Jews was rather
favorable. In 1492 he complied with the petition of the
Karaites of Troki, and confirmed the charter of Casimir IV.,
bestowing upon them the Magdeburg Law, and even supplementing
it by a few additional privileges. Various items of
public revenue, especially the customs duties, were as theretofore
let to the Jews. Alexander also paid the Jewish capitalists
part of the money advanced by them to his father. In 1495,
however, the Grand Duke suddenly issued a decree ordering
the expulsion of all the Jews from Lithuania. It is not
known whether this cruel action was due to the influence of the
anti-Jewish clerical party, and was stimulated by the news of
the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, or whether it was
prompted by the financial dependence of the ruler on his Jewish
creditors, or by the general desire to enrich himself at the
expense of the exiles. As a matter of fact Alexander confiscated
the immovable property of the expelled Jews in the districts
of Grodno, Brest, Lutzk, and Troki, and a large part
thereof was distributed by him among the local Christian
residents. The banished Jews emigrated partly to the Crimea
(Kaffa), but the majority settled, with the permission of King
John Albrecht, in the neighboring Polish cities. However,
when a few years later, after the death of his brother, Alexander
accepted, in addition, the crown of Poland (1501), he allowed
the Jews to return to Lithuania and settle in their former
places of residence. On this occasion they received back,
though not in all cases, the houses, estates, synagogues, and
cemeteries previously owned by them (1503).</p>

<p>By the beginning of the fourteenth century Polish Jewry
had become a big economic and social factor with which the
state was bound to reckon. It was now destined to become
also an independent spiritual entity, having stood for four
hundred years under the tutelage of the Jewish center in
Germany. The further development of this new factor forms
one of the most prominent features of the next period.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
THE AUTONOMOUS CENTER IN POLAND AT ITS
ZENITH (1501-1648)</h2>


<p>1. <span class="smcap">Social and Economic Conditions</span></p>

<p>In the same age in which the Jewish refugees from Spain
and Portugal were wending their steps towards the Turkish
East, bands of Jewish emigrants, fleeing from the stuffy ghettos
of Germany and Austria, could be seen wandering towards
the Slavonian East, towards Poland and Lithuania, where,
during the period of the Reformation, a large autonomous
Diaspora center sprang into life. The transmigration of Jewish
centers, which is so prominent a feature of the sixteenth
century, found its expression in two parallel movements: the
demolished or impoverished centers of Western Europe were
transplanted to the countries of Eastern Europe on the one
hand, and to the lands of contiguous Western Asia on the
other. Yet the destinies of the two Eastern centers&mdash;Turkey
and Poland&mdash;were not identical. The Sephardim of Turkey
were approaching the end of their brilliant historic career, and
were gradually lapsing into Asiatic stupor, while the Ashkenazim
of Poland, with a supply of fresh strength and the
promise of an original culture, were starting out on their broad
historic development. The mission of the Sephardim was a
memory of the past; that of the Ashkenazim was a hope for
the future. After medieval Babylonia and Spain, no country
presented so intense a concentration of Jewish energy and so
vast a field for the development of a Jewish autonomous life
as Poland in the sixteenth and the following centuries.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
The uninterrupted colonization of Slavonian lands by Jewish
emigrants from Germany, which had been going on during
the Middle Ages, prepared the soil for the historic process which
converted Poland from a colony into a center of Judaism. The
large Jewish population settled in the towns and villages of
Poland and Lithuania formed, not a downtrodden caste, nor a
homogeneous economic class, as in Germany, but an important
social entity, unfolding its energy in many departments of
social-economic life. It was not tied down to two exclusive
occupations, money-lending and petty trade, but it participated
in all branches of industrial endeavor, in production and manufacture,
not excluding rural avocations, such as land tenure
and farming. The men of wealth among the Jews farmed
the tolls (transit and customs duties) and the excise (state
taxes collected on wine<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and other articles of consumption),
and frequently attained to prominence as the financial agents of
the kings. When, at a later date, the Jews were hampered in
the business of tax-farming, their capital found a new outlet in
the lease of crown and Shlakhta estates, with the right of
"propination,"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> or liquor traffic, attached to it, as well as in
working the salt mines, in timbering forests, and opening up
the other resources of the soil. The big merchants were busy
exporting agrarian products from Poland into Austria, Moldavo-Wallachia,
and Turkey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> The lower classes engaged in
retail trade, handicrafts, farming, vegetable-growing, gardening,
and, in some places, particularly in Lithuania, even in
corn-growing.</p>

<p>The economic activity of the Jews, entwined with the material
life of the country by numerous threads, was bound to
produce a similar variety of form also in their legal condition.
Considering the peculiar caste structure of the Polish state and
the relative political freedom enjoyed in that semi-constitutional
country by the "governing classes"&mdash;the landed
nobility, the clergy, and partly the burghers&mdash;the legal position
of the Jews was of necessity determined by the conflict of
political and class interests. Bridled by an oligarchic constitution,
the royal power was bound to clash with the vast
privileges of the landed magnates, the big Shlakhta. The
latter, in turn, on the one hand fought the claims of the petty
rural Shlakhta, and on the other resisted the advance of the
Christian urban estates, the business men, and craftsmen, who
were a powerful factor, owing to their municipal autonomy
and their well-organized guilds. The fight was carried on in
the Diets, municipalities, and law courts. Within this conflict
of economic interests the clergy of the dominant Catholic
Church pursued its own line of attack. Having been weakened
during the Reformation, it now renewed its strength in
consequence of the Catholic reaction and the arduous endeavors
of the Jesuits.</p>

<p>These estates differed in their relation to the Jews, each in
accordance with its own interests. Medieval ideas had already
taken such deep root in the Polish people that, despite the
constitutional character of the country, a humane and lawful
attitude towards the Jews was out of the question. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
were appraised according to the advantages they could bestow
upon this or that class, and since in many cases what was advantageous
to one class was disadvantageous to another, a conflict
of interests was unavoidable, with the result that the Jews
were the objects of protection on the one side and the targets
of persecution on the other.</p>

<p>The Jews of Poland were favored by two powers within the
state, by royalty and in part by the big Shlakhta. They were
opposed by two others, the clergy and the burghers. Aside
from the interests of the exchequer, which was swelled by
regular and irregular imposts upon the Jews, the kings derived
personal benefits from their commercial activities. They
valued the financial services of the Jewish tax-farmers, who
paid large sums in advance for the lease of customs duties
and state revenues or for the tenure of the royal domains.
These contractors and tenants became, as a rule, financial
agents of the kings, owing to their ability to advance large
sums of money, and were incidentally in a position to exert
their influence upon the court in the interest of their coreligionists.
The high nobility in turn appreciated the usefulness
of the Jewish farmers and tenants to their estates, which they
themselves, with their aristocratic indifference and indolence,
knew only how to mismanage. The protection which this class
accorded the Jews, principally at the Diets controlled by them,
was in exact proportion to the services rendered by the Jews as
middlemen between them and the peasants. The magnates
accordingly were entirely indifferent to the welfare of the
rest of Jewry, the toiling masses of the Jewish population.</p>

<p>Uncompromising hostility to the Jews marked the attitude
of the urban estates, the merchants and artisans of the burgher
class, with a considerable sprinkling of German settlers, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
influence was clearly noticeable. These organized tradesmen
and handicraftsmen looked upon the Jews as their direct competitors.
The magistracies, acting as the organs of municipal
self-government, placed severe restrictions upon the Jews in
the acquisition of real estate and in the pursuit of business and
handicrafts, while the trade-unions occasionally set the riotous
mobs at their heels. Still more resolute was the agitation of the
Catholic clergy, which frequently succeeded in influencing
legislation in the spirit of ecclesiastic intolerance.</p>

<p>The interaction of all these forces shaped the legal and social
status of the Polish-Lithuanian Jews in the course of the sixteenth
and in the beginning of the seventeenth century, at a
time when Poland was passing through the zenith of her political
prosperity. The vacillations and upheavals in the position
of the Jews were conditioned by the shifting of forces in the
direction of the one or the other above-mentioned factors in the
course of history.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Liberal Régime of Sigismund I.</span></p>

<p>The opening years of the sixteenth century found the Jews
fully restored to the rights of which their enemies had attempted
to rob them at the end of the preceding century. Alexander
Yaghello, the very same Lithuanian Grand Duke who, from
some obscure motive, had banished the Jews from his dominions
in 1495,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> found it necessary to call them back as soon as he
ascended the throne of Poland, after the demise of his brother.
In 1503, "having consulted the lords of the realm," King
Alexander announced his decision to the effect that the Jews
exiled from Grodno and other cities of Lithuania should be
allowed to return and settle "near the castles and in the
localities in which they had lived formerly," and should be
given back the houses, synagogues, cemeteries, farms, and
fields, which had previously been in their possession. The
reasons for this change of front may easily be traced to the
vast economic importance of the Jews of the Polish Kingdom,
which had shortly before, in 1501, entered into a closer union
with Lithuania, and to the invaluable services of the Jewish
tax-farmers, on whom the royal budget to a large extent
depended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>One of these "royal financiers" was the wealthy Yosko,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> who
farmed the customs and tolls in nearly half of Poland. To
stimulate the endeavors of his financier, King Alexander
exempted Yosko and his employees from the authority of the
local administration, placing him, after the manner of court
dignitaries, under the jurisdiction of the royal court. But,
taken as a whole, the King was even now far from friendly to
the Jews. In 1505 he permitted the inclusion of the ancient
charter of Boleslav of Kalish, the <i>magna charta</i> of Jewish
liberties, in the code of organic Polish laws, which was then
being edited by the chancellor John Laski. But he was careful
to point out that he did not thereby intend to ratify Boleslav's
charter anew, but allowed its reproduction "for the purpose
of safeguarding [the Christian population] against the Jews"
(<i>ad cautelam defensionis contra Judaeos</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Alexander's successor, Sigismund I. Yaghello (1506-1548),
King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, favored a more
liberal policy towards his Jewish subjects. Though a staunch
Catholic, Sigismund was free from the spirit of anti-Jewish
clericalism, and he endeavored to the best of his ability to live
up to the principle proclaimed by him, that "equal justice
should be meted out to the rich and mighty lords and to the
meanest pauper." This lofty principle, so little compatible
with the policy of class discrimination, could, however inadequately,
be applied only there where the power of royalty was
not handicapped by the mighty Shlakhta and the other estates.
The only part of the Polish Empire where such a condition still
existed in the time of Sigismund I. was Lithuania, the patrimony
of the Yaghellos. There the royal, or rather the grand
ducal, authority was more extensive and its form of manifestation
more patriarchal than in the provinces of the Crown, or
Poland proper. By intrusting a large part of the public tax
contracts and land leases to the Jewish capitalists, the King
could feel easy in his mind as to the integrity of his budget.
The general contractor of the customs and other state revenues
in Lithuania, Michael Yosefovich (son of Joseph), a Jew from
Brest-Litovsk, exercised occasionally also the functions of
grand ducal treasurer, being commissioned to pay out of the
collected imposts the salaries of the local officials as well as the
debts of his royal master.</p>

<p>Prompted by the desire of rewarding the services of his
financier and at the same time putting the communal affairs
of his Jewish subjects in better order, Sigismund appointed
Michael Yosefovich to serve as the elder, or, to use the official
term, the "senior," of all Lithuanian Jews (1514). The
"senior" was invested with far-reaching powers: he had the
right of conferring directly with the king in all important
Jewish affairs, dispensing justice to his coreligionists in accordance
with their own laws, and collecting from them the taxes
imposed by the state. He was to be assisted by a rabbi or
"doctor," an expert in Jewish law. Whether the Lithuanian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Jews acknowledged Michael Yosefovich as their supreme authority
is open to doubt. The wealthy contractor, whom the
will of the King had placed at the head of the Jews, could not
in point of fact preside over their autonomous organization and
their judiciary and rabbinate, since what was required was not
officials, but men with special knowledge and training. All
Michael could do was to act as the official go-between, representing
the Jewish communities before the King and defending
their rights and privileges as well as their commercial and
fiscal interests. In any event Michael was more useful to his
coreligionists than his brother Abraham Yosefovich, who, likewise
a tax-farmer, sacrificed his Judaism for the sake of a
successful career. King Alexander conferred upon Abraham
the rank of Starosta of Smolensk, while Sigismund raised him
to the exalted position of Chancellor of the Lithuanian Exchequer.
Abraham and his offspring were soon lost in the ranks of
the higher Polish nobility.</p>

<p>In agricultural Lithuania with its patriarchal conditions
of life the antagonism between the classes was in its infancy,
and as a result the right of the Jews to freedom of transit and
occupation was but rarely contested. They lived in the towns
and villages, and were not yet so sharply marked off, in
language and mode of life, from the Christian population as
they became afterwards. The Jewish communities of Brest,
Grodno, Pinsk, and Troki, the last consisting principally of
Karaites, who had a municipality of their own, were important
Jewish centers in the Duchy, and enjoyed considerable autonomy.
The rabbi of Brest, Mendel Frank, received from the
King extensive administrative and judicial powers, including
the right of imposing the <i>herem</i> and other penalties upon the
recalcitrant members of the community (1531).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>In the large cities of Poland proper the position of the Jews
was not nearly so favorable. Here commercial life had attained
a higher stage of development than in Lithuania, and in
many lines of business the Jews competed with the Christians.
Taking advantage of the autonomy granted to the
estates in the shape of the Magdeburg Law, the Christian
business men and handicraftsmen, represented by their magistracies
and trade-unions, were constantly endeavoring to restrict
their rivals in their commercial pursuits. This was
particularly the case in Posen, Cracow, and Lemberg, the leading
centers respectively of the three provinces of Great Poland,
Little Poland, and Red Russia (Galicia). In Posen the Jews
were hampered by the burgomaster and the aldermen in carrying
on their business or in displaying their goods in stores outside
the Jewish quarter. When the Jews protested to the King,
he warned the authorities of Posen not to subject their rivals
to any hardships or to violate their privileges (1517). The
Christian merchants retorted that the Jews occupied the best
shops, not only in the center of the town, but also on the
market-place, where formerly only "prominent Christian merchants,
both native and foreign [German], had been doing
business," and where, in view of the concentration of large
masses of Christians, the presence of Jews might lead to
"great temptations," and even to seduction from the path of
the "true faith." The reference to religion, used as a cloak
for commercial greed, did not fail to impress the devout
Sigismund, and he forbade the Jews to keep stores on the
market-place (1520). The professors of Christian love in
Posen similarly forbade their Jewish fellow-citizens to buy
foodstuffs and other articles in the market until the Christian
residents had completed their purchases. A little later the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
King, in consequence of the influx of Jews into Posen, gave
orders that no new Jewish settlers be admitted into the city, and
that no houses owned by Christians be sold to them, without the
permission of the Kahal elders. The Jews were to be restricted
to definite quarters and to be denied the right of building their
houses among those belonging to Christians (1523).</p>

<p>The same was the case in Lemberg. Yielding to the complaints
of the magistracy about the competition of the Jews, the
King restricted their freedom of commerce in several particulars,
barring them from selling cloth in the whole of [Red]
Russia and Podolia, except at the fairs, and limiting their sale
of horned cattle to two thousand head per year (1515). The
Piotrkov Diet of 1521 passed a law confining the trade of the
Lemberg Jews to four articles, wax, furs, cloth, and horned
cattle. These restrictions were the result of the widespread
agitation which the pious Christian merchants had been conducting
against their business rivals of other faiths. The
magistracies of the three cities of Posen, Lemberg, and Cracow,
attempted to form a coalition for the purpose of carrying on a
joint economic fight against Jewry. In Cracow and its suburb
Kazimiezh<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> the Jews had to endure even harsher restrictions
in business than in the other two metropolitan centers of
Poland.</p>

<p>Competition in business occasionally resulted in physical
violence and street riots. Anti-Jewish attacks were taking
place in Posen and in Brest-Kuyavsk,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and outbreaks were
anticipated in Cracow. Representatives of the last Jewish
community made their apprehensions known to the King.
Sigismund issued a decree in 1530 denouncing in vehement
terms the insolence of the rioters, who were hoping for immunity,
and rigorously forbidding all acts of violence, under
penalty of death and confiscation of property. To allay the
fears of the Jews he ordered the burghers of Cracow to deposit
the sum of ten thousand gulden with the exchequer as security
for the maintenance of peace and safety in the city. The
burgomasters, aldermen, and trade-unions were warned by the
King that in all their differences with Jews "they should
proceed in a legal manner, and not by violence, by resorting
to force of arms and inciting disorders."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
The King was powerless, however, to shield the Jews against
other unpleasant manifestations of the Polish class <i>régime</i>,
such as the extortions of the officials. The highest dignitaries
of the court no less than the local administration were ever
ready to fish in the troubled waters of the conflict of classes.
The second wife of Sigismund, Queen Bona Sforza, an avaricious
Italian princess, sold the offices of the state to the highest
bidder, while the courtiers and voyevodas were just as venal
on their own behalf. The queen's favorite, Peter Kmita,
Voyevoda of Cracow and Marshal of the Crown, managed to
accept bribes simultaneously from the Jewish and the Christian
merchants, who lodged complaints against each other, by
promising both sides to defend their interests before the Diet
or the King.</p>

<p>During the fourth decade of the sixteenth century the
Jewish question became the object of violent disputes at the
Polish Diets, the deputies of several regions having received
anti-Jewish instructions.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Now the controlling factor in the
Polish Diets was the Shlakhta, whose attitude towards the
Jews was not uniform. The big Shlakhta, the magnates, the
owners of huge estates and whole towns, were favorably disposed
towards the Jews who lived in their domains, and added
to their wealth as farmers and tax-payers. But the petty
Shlakhta, the struggling squires, who were looking for places
in the civil and state service, arrayed themselves on the
side of the burgher class, which had always been hostile to the
Jews. This petty Shlakhta bitterly resented the fact that the
royal revenues had been turned over to Jewish contractors,
who, as collectors of customs and taxes, attained to official
dignity, and gradually forced their way into the ranks of the
nobility. The income from the collection of the revenues and
the influence connected with it this Shlakhta regarded as
its inalienable prerogative. The clergy again saw in this
enhancement of Jewish influence a serious menace to the
Catholic faith, while the urban estates had a vital interest
in limiting the commercial rights of the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
At the Piotrkov Diet of 1538 the anti-Jewish agitation was
carried on with considerable success. It resulted in the adoption
of a statute, or a "constitution," containing a separate
Jewish section, in which the old canonical laws cropped out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We hereby prescribe and decree&mdash;it is stated in that section&mdash;that
from now on and for all future time all those who manage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>our revenues must unconditionally be members of the landed
nobility, and persons professing the Christian faith.... We ordain
for inviolable observance that no Jews shall be intrusted [in
the capacity of contractors] with the collection of revenues of any
kind. For it is unworthy and contrary to divine right that persons
of this description should be admitted to any kind of honors or
to the discharge of public functions among Christian people.</p></div>

<p>It is further decreed that the Jews have no right of unrestricted
commerce, and can do no business in any locality,
except with the special permission of the king or by agreement
with the magistracies; in the villages they are forbidden
to trade altogether. Pawnbroking and money-lending on the
part of Jews are hedged about by a series of oppressive regulations.
The capstone of the Piotrkov "constitution" is the
following clause:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas the Jews, disregarding the ancient regulations, have
thrown off the marks by which they were distinguishable from
the Christians, and have arrogated to themselves a form of dress
which closely resembles that of the Christians, so that it is impossible
to recognize them, be it resolved for permanent observance:
that the Jews of our realm, all and sundry, in whatever
place they happen to be found, shall wear special marks, to wit, a
barret, or hat, or some other headgear of yellow cloth. Exception
is to be made in favor of travelers, who, while on the road, shall
be permitted to discard or conceal marks of this kind.</p></div>

<p>The fine for violating this regulation is fixed at one gulden.</p>

<p>The only articles of the "constitution" of 1538 which
had serious consequences for the Jews of the Crown&mdash;the
Jews of Lithuania were not affected by these regulations&mdash;were
those barring them from tax-farming and subjecting
them to commercial restrictions. The canonical law concerning
a distinctive headgear was more in the nature of a demonstration
than a serious legal enactment, since compliance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
it, owing to the high state of culture among the Polish Jews
and their important rôle in the economic life of the country,
was a matter of impossibility. Behind this regulation lurks
the hand of the Catholic clergy, which was alarmed at that
time by the initial successes of the Reformation in Poland,
and was in fear that the influence of Judaism might enhance
the progress of the heresy. The excited imagination of the
clerical fanatics perceived signs of a "Jewish propaganda" in
the rationalistic doctrine of "Anti-Trinitarianism," which was
then making its appearance, denying the dogma of the Holy
Trinity. The specter of a rising sect of "Judaizers" haunted
the guardians of the Church. One occurrence in particular
engendered tremendous excitement among the inhabitants of
Cracow. A Catholic woman of that city, Catherine Zaleshovska
by name, the wife of an alderman, and four score years of
age, was convicted of denying the fundamental dogmas of
Christianity and adhering secretly to Jewish doctrines. The
Bishop of Cracow, Peter Gamrat, having made futile endeavors
to bring Catherine back into the fold of the Church, condemned
her to death. The unfortunate woman was burned at the stake
on the market-place of Cracow in 1539.</p>

<p>The following description of this event was penned by an
eye-witness, the Polish writer Lucas Gurnitzki:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The priest Gamrat, Bishop of Cracow, assembled all canons
and collegiates in order to examine her [Catherine Zaleshovska,
who had been accused of "Judaizing"] as to her principles of
faith. When, in accordance with our creed, she was asked whether
she believed in Almighty God, the Creator of heaven and earth,
she replied: "I believe in God, who created all that we see and
do not see, who cannot be comprehended by the human reason,
who poureth forth His bounty over man and over all things in the
universe." "Do you believe in His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost?" she was asked. She
answered: "The Lord God has neither wife nor son, nor does
He need them. For sons are needed by those who die, but God
is eternal, and since He was not born, it is impossible that He
should die. It is we whom He considers His sons, and His sons
are those who walk in His paths." Here the collegiates shouted:
"Thou utterest evil, thou miserable one! Bethink thyself! Surely
there are prophecies that the Lord would send His Son into the
world to be crucified for our sins, in order that we, having been disobedient
from the days of our ancestor Adam, may be reconciled
to God the Father?" A great deal more was said by the learned
men to the apostate woman, but the more they spoke, the more
stubborn was she in her contention that God was not and could
not be born as a human being. When it was found impossible to
detach her from her Jewish beliefs, it was decided to convict her
of blasphemy. She was taken to the city jail, and a few days later
she was burned. She went to her death without the slightest fear.</p></div>

<p>The well-known contemporary chronicler Bielski expresses
himself similarly: "She went to her death as if it were a
wedding."</p>

<p>During the same time there were rumors afloat to the effect
that in various places in Poland, particularly in the province
of Cracow, many Christians were embracing Judaism, and,
after undergoing circumcision, were fleeing for greater safety
to Lithuania, where they were sheltered by the local Jews.
When the rumor reached the King, he dispatched two commissioners
to Lithuania to direct a strict investigation. The
officers of the King proceeded with excessive ardor; they
raided Jewish homes, and stopped travelers on the road, making
arrests and holding cross-examinations. The inquiry
failed to reveal the presence of Judaizing sectarians in Lithuania,
though it caused the Jews considerable trouble and alarm
(1539).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely had this investigation been closed when the Lithuanian
Jews were faced by another charge. Many of them were
said to be on the point of leaving the country, and, acting with
the knowledge and co-operation of the Sultan, intended to
emigrate to Turkey, accompanied by the Christians who had
been converted to Judaism. It was even rumored that the
Jews had already succeeded in dispatching a party of circumcised
Christian children and adults across the Moldavian frontier.
The King gave orders for a new investigation, which
was marked, like the preceding one, by acts of lawlessness and
violence. The Jews were in fear that the King might lend an
ear to these accusations and withdraw his protection from
them. Accordingly Jews of Brest, Grodno, and other Lithuanian
cities, hastened to send a deputation to King Sigismund,
which solemnly assured him that all the rumors and
accusations concerning them were mere slander, that the
Lithuanian Jews were faithfully devoted to their country,
that they had no intention to emigrate to Turkey, and, finally,
that they had never tried to convert Christians to their faith.
At the same time they made complaints about the insults and
brutalities which had been inflicted upon them, pointing to
the detrimental effect of the investigation on the trade of the
country. The assertions of the deputation were borne out
by the official inquiry, and Sigismund, returning his favor
to the Jews, cleared them of all suspicion, and promised henceforward
not to trouble them on wholesale charges unsupported
by evidence. This pledge was embodied in a special charter,
a sort of <i>habeas corpus</i>, granted by the King to the Jews of
Lithuania in 1540.</p>

<p>All this, however, did not discourage the Catholic clergy,
who, under the leadership of Bishop Gamrat, continued their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
agitation against the hated Jews. They incited public opinion
against them by means of slanderous books, written in medieval
style (<i>De stupendis erroribus Judaeorum</i>, 1541; <i>De sanctis
interfectis a Judaeis</i>, 1543). The Church Synod of 1542
assembled in Piotrkov issued the following "constitution":</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Synod, taking into consideration the many dangers that
confront the Christians and the Church from the large number of
Jews who, having been driven from the neighboring countries,
have been admitted into Poland, and unscrupulously combine holiness
with ungodliness, has passed the following resolution: Lest
the great concentration of Jews in the country lead, as must be
apprehended, to even worse consequences, his Majesty the King be
petitioned as follows: 1. That in the diocese of Gnesen and particularly
in the city of Cracow<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> the number of Jews be reduced to a
fixed norm, such as the district set aside for them can accommodate.
2. That in all other places where the Jews did not reside in
former times they be denied the right of settlement, and be forbidden
to buy houses from Christians, those already bought to be
returned to their former owners. 3. That the new synagogues, even
those erected by them in the city of Cracow, be ordered to be
demolished. 4. Whereas the Church suffers the Jews for the sole
purpose of recalling to our minds the tortures of our Saviour,
their number shall in no circumstances increase. Moreover, according
to the regulations of the holy canons, they shall be permitted
only to repair their old synagogues but not erect new ones.</p></div>

<p>This is followed by seven more clauses containing various
restrictions. The Jews are forbidden to keep Christian servants
in their houses, particularly nursery-maids, to act as stewards
of estates belonging to nobles ("lest those who ought to be
the slaves of Christians should thereby acquire dominion and
jurisdiction over them"), to work and to trade on Catholic
holidays, and to offer their goods publicly for sale even on weekdays.
It goes without saying that the rule prescribing a distinguishing
Jewish dress is not neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>This whole anti-Jewish fabric of laws, which the members of
the Synod decided to submit to the King, failed to receive
legal sanction. Still the Catholic clergy was for a long time
guided by it in its policy towards the Jews, a policy, needless
to say, of intolerance and gross prejudices. These restrictions
were the <i>pia desideria</i> of priests and monks, some of which were
realized during the subsequent Catholic reaction.</p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap">Liberalism and Reaction in the Reigns of Sigismund
Augustus and Stephen Batory</span></p>

<p>Sigismund I.'s successor, the cultured and to some extent
liberal-minded Sigismund II. Augustus (1548-1572), followed
in his relations with the Jews the same principles of toleration
and non-interference by which he was generally guided in his
attitude towards the non-Christian and non-Catholic citizens
of Poland. In the first year of his reign Sigismund II., complying
with the request of the Jews of Great Poland, ratified,
at the general Polish Diet held at Piotrkov, the old liberal
statute of Casimir IV. In the preamble of this enactment the
King declares that he confirms the rights and privileges of the
Jews on the same grounds as the special privileges of the other
estates, in other words, by virtue of his oath to uphold the
constitution. Sigismund Augustus considerably amplified
and solidified the self-government of the Jewish communities.
He bestowed large administrative and judicial powers upon the
rabbis and Kahal elders, sanctioning the application of "Jewish
law" (<i>i. e.</i> of Biblical and Talmudical law) in civil
and partly even criminal cases between Jews (1551). In the
general voyevoda courts, in which cases between Jews and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Christians were tried, the presence of Jewish "seniors," <i>i. e.</i>
of duly elected Kahal elders, was required (1556). This liability
of the Jews to the royal or voyevoda courts had long
constituted one of their important privileges, since it exempted
them from the municipal, or magistrates' courts, which were
just as hostile to them as the magistracies themselves.</p>

<p>This prerogative&mdash;the guarantee of greater impartiality on
the part of the royal court&mdash;was limited to the Jews residing
in the royal cities and villages, and did not extend to those
living on the estates of the nobles or in the townships owned
by them. Sigismund I. had decreed that "the nobles having
Jews in their towns and villages may enjoy all the
advantages to be derived from them, but must also try their
cases. For we [the King], not deriving any advantages from
such Jews, are not obliged to secure justice for them" (1539).
Sigismund Augustus now enacted similarly that the Jews
living on hereditary Shlakhta estates should be liable to the
jurisdiction of the "hereditary owner," not to that of the
royal representatives, the voyevoda and sub-voyevoda. As for
the other royal privileges, they were extended to the Jews of
this category only on condition of their paying the special
Jewish head-tax to the King (1549). The split between
royalty and Shlakhta, which became conspicuous in the reign
of Sigismund Augustus, had already begun to undermine the
system of royal patronage, more and more weakened as time
went on.</p>

<p>The relations between the Jews and the "third estate," the
burghers, did not improve in the reign of Sigismund Augustus,
but they assumed a more definite shape. The two competing
agencies, the magistracies and the Kahals, regulated their
mutual relations by means of compacts and agreements. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
some cities, such as Cracow and Posen, these compacts were
designed to safeguard the boundaries of the ghetto, outside
of which the Jews had no right to live; in Posen the Jews were
even forbidden to increase the number of Jewish houses over
and above a fixed norm (49), with the result that they were
obliged to build tall houses, with several stories. In other
cities, among which was included the city of Warsaw,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the
magistracies managed to obtain the so-called privilege <i>de non
tolerandis Judaeis</i>, <i>i. e.</i> the right of either not admitting the
Jews to settle anew, and confining those already settled to
special sections of the city, away from the principal streets, or
keeping the Jews away from the city altogether, allowing
only the merchants to come on business and stay there for a
few days. However, in the majority of Polish cities the protection
of the King secured for the Jews equal rights with the
other townspeople. For, as one of the royal edicts puts it, "inasmuch
as the Jews carry all burdens in the same way as the
burghers, their positions must be alike in everything, except
in religion and jurisdiction." In some places the King even
went so far as to forbid the holding of the weekly market-day
on Saturday, to safeguard the commercial interests of the
Jews, who refused to do business on their day of rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>With all the estates of Poland the Jews managed reasonably
to agree save only with the Catholic clergy. This implacable
foe of Judaism doubled his efforts as soon as the signal from
Rome was given to start a reaction against the growing heresy
of Protestantism and to combat all other forms of non-Catholic
belief. The policy of Paul IV., the inquisitor on the throne
of St. Peter, found an echo in Poland. The Papal Nuncio
Lippomano, having arrived from Rome, conceived the idea of
firing the religious zeal of the Catholics by one of those bloody
spectacles which the inquisitorial Church was wont to arrange
occasionally <i>ad maiorem Dei gloriam</i>. A rumor was set afloat
that a poor woman in Sokhachev, Dorothy Lazhentzka by
name, had sold to the Jews of the town the holy wafer received
by her during communion, and that the wafer was
stabbed by the "infidels" until it began to bleed. By order
of the Bishop of Khelm three Jews who were charged with
this sacrilege and their accomplice Dorothy Lazhentzka were
thrown into prison, put on the rack, and finally sentenced to
death. On learning of these happenings, the King sent orders
to the Starosta of Sokhachev to stop the execution of the
death sentence, but the clergy hastened to carry out the
verdict,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and the alleged blasphemers were burned at the stake
(1556). Before their death the martyred Jews made the following
declaration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have never stabbed the host, because we do not believe that
the host is the Divine body (<i>nos enim nequaquam credimus
hostiae inesse Dei corpus</i>), knowing that God has no body nor
blood. We believe, as did our forefathers, that the Messiah is
not God, but His messenger. We also know from experience that
there can be no blood in flour.</p></div>

<p>These protestations of a monotheistic faith were silenced
by the executioner, who stopped "the mouths of the criminals
with burning torches."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Sigismund Augustus was shocked by these revolting proceedings,
which had been engineered by the Nuncio Lippomano. He
was quick to grasp that at the bottom of the absurd rumor
concerning the "wounded" host lay a "pious fraud," the
desire to demonstrate the truth of the Eucharist dogma in its
Catholic formulation (the bread of communion as the actual
body of Christ), which was rejected by the Calvinists and the
extreme wing of the Reformation. "I am shocked by this
hideous villainy," the King exclaimed in a fit of religious skepticism,
"nor am I sufficiently devoid of common sense to believe
that there could be any blood in the host." Lippomano's
conduct aroused in particular the indignation of the Polish
Protestants, who on dogmatic grounds could not give credence
to the medieval fable concerning miracle-working hosts.
All this did not prevent the enemies of the Jews from exploiting
the Sokhachev case in the interest of an anti-Jewish
agitation. It was in all likelihood due to this agitation that
the anti-Jewish "constitution" adopted by the Diet of 1538
was, at the insistence of numerous deputies, confirmed by the
Diets of 1562 and 1565.</p>

<p>The articles of this anti-Semitic "constitution" were also
embodied in the "Lithuanian Statute" promulgated in 1566.
This "statute" interdicts the Jews from wearing the same
style of clothes as the Christians and altogether from dressing
smartly, from owning serfs or keeping domestics of the Christian
faith, and from holding office among Christians, the
last two restrictions being extended to the Tatars and other
"infidels." The medieval libels found a favorable soil even
in Lithuania. In 1564 a Jew was executed in Bielsk, on the
charge of having killed a Christian girl, though the unfortunate
victim loudly proclaimed his innocence from the steps
of the scaffold. Nor were attempts wanting to manufacture
similar trials in other Lithuanian localities. To put an end to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the agitation fostered by fanatics and obscurantists, the King
issued two decrees, in 1564 and 1566, in which the local
authorities were strictly enjoined not to institute proceedings
against Jews on the charge of ritual murder or desecration of
hosts. Sigismund Augustus declares that experience and papal
pronouncements had proved the groundlessness of such
charges; that, in accordance with ancient Jewish privileges,
all such charges must be substantiated by the testimony of
four Christian and three Jewish witnesses, and that, finally,
the jurisdiction in all such cases belongs to the King himself
and his Council at the General Diet.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, in 1569, the agreement known as the
"Union of Lublin" was concluded between Lithuania and the
Crown, or Poland proper, providing for closer administrative
and legislative co-operation between the two countries. This
resulted in the co-ordination of the constitutional legislation
for both parts of the "Republic,"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> which, in turn, affected
injuriously the status of the Jews of Lithuania. The latter
country was gradually drawn into the general current of
Polish politics, and hence drifted away from the patriarchal
order of things, which had built up the prosperity of the Jews
in the days of Vitovt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Sigismund Augustus died in 1572, three years after the conclusion
of the Union of Lublin. The Jews had good reason
to mourn the loss of this King, who had been their principal
protector. His death marks the extinction of the Yaghello
dynasty, and a new chapter begins in the history of Poland,
"the elective period," when the kings are chosen by vote. After
a protracted interregnum, the Shlakhta elected the French
prince Henry of Valois (1574), one of the instigators of the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew. This election greatly alarmed
the Jews and the liberal-minded Poles, who anticipated a recrudescence
of clericalism; but their fears were soon allayed.
After a few months' stay in Poland, Henry fled to his native
land to accept the French crown, on the death of his brother
Charles IX. The throne of Poland fell, by popular vote,
to Stephen Batory (1576-1586), the valorous and enlightened
Hungarian duke. His brief reign, which marks the end of
the "golden age" of Polish history, was signalized by several
acts of justice in relation to the Jews. In 1576 Stephen
Batory issued two edicts, strictly forbidding the impeachment
of Jews on the charge of ritual murder or sacrilege, in view of
the recognized falsity of these accusations<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and the popular
disturbances accompanying them.</p>

<p>Stephen Batory even went one step further in pursuing the
principle, that the Jews, because of their usefulness to the
country on account of their commercial activity, had a claim to
the same treatment as the corresponding Christian estates. In
ratifying the old charters, he added a number of privileges,
bearing in particular on the freedom of commerce. The King
directed the voyevodas to protect the legitimate interests of the
Jews against the encroachments of the magistracies and trade-unions,
who hampered them in every possible manner in their
pursuit of trades and handicrafts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Stephen Batory intervened on behalf of the Jews of Posen,
who had long been oppressed by a hostile magistracy. Setting
aside the draconian regulations of the city fathers, the commercial
rivals of the Jews, he permitted the latter to hire business
premises in all parts of the city and ply their trade even on the
days of the Christian festivals. Anticipating the possibility
of retaliatory measures on the part of the townspeople, the
King impressed upon the magistracy the duty of safeguarding
the inviolability of life and property in the city, at the risk of
incurring the severest penalties in the case of neglect (1577).
All these warnings, however, were powerless to avert a catastrophe.
Three months after the promulgation of the royal
edict the Jewish quarter in Posen was attacked by the mob,
which looted Jewish property and killed a number of Jews.
Ostensibly the riot was started because of the refusal of the
Jews to allow one of their coreligionists, who was on the point
of accepting baptism, to meet his wife. In reality this was
nothing but a pretext. The attack had been prepared by the
Christian merchants, who could not reconcile themselves to
the extension of the commercial rights of their competitors.
Batory imposed a heavy fine on the Posen magistracy for
having failed to stop the disorders. Only when the members
of the magistracy declared under oath that they had been
entirely ignorant of the plot was the fine revoked.</p>

<p>As far as the Jews are concerned, Stephen Batory remained
loyal to the traditions of a more liberal age, at a time when
the Polish populace was already inoculated with the ideas of
the "Catholic reaction" imported from Western Europe&mdash;ideas
which in other respects the King himself was unable to
resist. It was during his reign that the Jesuits, Peter Skarga
and others, made their appearance as an active, organized
body. Batory extended his patronage to them, and intrusted
them with the management of the academy established by him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
at Vilna. Was it possible for the King to foresee all the evil,
darkness, and intolerance which these Jesuit schools would
spread all over Poland? Could it have occurred to him that in
these seats of learning, which soon monopolized the education
of the ruling as well as the middle classes, one of the chief
subjects of instruction would be a systematic course in Jew-baiting?</p>


<p>4. <span class="smcap">Shlakhta and Royalty in the Reigns of
Sigismund III. and Vladislav IV</span>.</p>

<p>The results of the upheaval which accompanied the extinction
of the Yaghello dynasty assumed definite shape under the
first two kings of the Swedish Vasa dynasty, Sigismund III.
(1588-1632) and Vladislav IV. (1632-1648). The elective
character of royalty made the latter dependent on the Shlakhta,
which practically ruled the country, subordinating parliamentary
legislation to the aristocratic and agricultural interests
of their estate, and almost monopolizing the posts of voyevodas,
starostas, and other important officials. At the same time the
activity of the Jesuits strengthened the influence of clericalism
in all departments of life. To eradicate Protestantism, to
oppress the Greek Orthodox "peasant Church," and to reduce
the Jews to the level of an ostracized caste of outlaws&mdash;such
was the program of the Catholic reaction in Poland.</p>

<p>To attain these ends draconian measures were adopted against
the Evangelists and Arians.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The members of the Greek Orthodox
Church were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> forced against their will into a union with the
Catholics, and the rights of the "dissidents," or non-conformists,
were constantly curtailed. The Jesuits, who managed to
obtain control over the education of the growing generation,
inoculated the Polish people with the virus of clericalism.
The less the zealots of the Church had reason to expect the
conversion of the Jews, the more did they despise and humiliate
them. And if they did not altogether succeed in restoring
the medieval order of things, it was no doubt due to the
fact that the structure of the Polish state, with its irrepressible
conflict of class interests, did not allow any kind of
system to take firm root. "Poland subsists on disorders,"
was the boast of the political leaders of the age. The "golden
liberty" of the Shlakhta degenerated more and more. It
became a weapon in the hands of the higher classes to oppress
the middle and the lower classes. It led to anarchy, it undermined
the authority of the Diet, in which a single member
could impose his veto on the decision of the whole assembly
(the so-called <i>liberum veto</i>), and resulted in endless dissensions
between the estates. On the other hand, one must not forget
that, while this division of power was disastrous for Poland,
the absolute concentration of power after the pattern of
Western Europe, in the circumstances then prevailing, might
have proved even more disastrous. Under a system of monarchic
absolutism, Poland might have become, during the
period of the Catholic reaction, another Spain of Philip II.
Disorder and class strife saved the Polish people from the
"order" of the Inquisition and the consistency of autocratic
hangmen.</p>

<p>The championship of Jewish interests passed by degrees from
the hands of royalty into those of the wealthy parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Shlakhta. Though more and more permeated by clerical tendencies,
the fruit of Jesuit schooling, the nobility in most cases
held its protecting hand over the Jews, to whom it was tied by
the community of economic interests. The Jewish tax-collector
in the towns and townlets, which were privately owned by the
nobles, the Jewish <i>arendar</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> in the village, who procured an
income for the <i>pan</i><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> from dairying, milling, distilling, liquor-selling
and other enterprises&mdash;they were indispensable to
the easy-going magnate, who was wont to let his estates take
care of themselves, and while away his time in the capital, at
the court, in merry amusements, or at the tumultuous sessions
of the national and provincial assemblies, where politics
were looked upon as a form of entertainment rather than a
serious pursuit. This Polish aristocracy put a check on the
anti-Semitic endeavors of the clergy, and confined the oppression
of the Jews within certain limits. Even the devout Sigismund
III., who was subject to Jesuit influence, continued
the traditional rôle of Jewish protector. In 1588, shortly
after his accession to the throne, he confirmed, at the request of
the Jews, their right of trading in the cities, though not
without certain restrictions which the demands of the Christian
merchants had forced upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless the economic struggle in the cities continues
with ever-increasing fury, manifesting itself more and more
in the shape of malign religious fanaticism. In many cities
the municipalities arrogate to themselves judicial authority
over the Jews&mdash;the authority of the wolves over the sheep&mdash;contrary
to the fundamental Polish law, which places all litigation
between Jews and Christians under the jurisdiction of
the royal officials, the voyevodas and starostas. The king,
appealed to by the injured, has frequent occasion to remind
the magistracies that the Jews are not to be judged by the
Magdeburg Law, but by common Polish law, in addition to
their own rabbinical courts for internal disputes. A pronouncement
of this nature was issued, among others, by King
Sigismund III., when the Jews of Brest appealed to him
against the local municipality (1592). Their appeal was supported
by the head of the Jewish community, Saul Yudich
(son of Judah), contractor of customs and other state revenues
in Lithuania, who wielded considerable influence at
the Polish court. He bore the title of "servant of the king,"
and was frequently in a position to render important services
to his coreligionists.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> But where the Jewish masses were not
fortunate enough to possess such powerful advocates in the
persons of the big tax-farmers and "servants of the king,"
their legitimate interests were frequently trampled upon. The
burghers of Vilna, in their desire to dislodge their Jewish competitors
from the city, did not stop at open violence. They
demolished the synagogue, and sacked the Jewish residences
in the houses owned by the Shlakhta (1592). In Kiev, where
the Jews had been settled in the Old Russian period,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the
burghers were endeavoring to secure from the King the privilege
<i>de non tolerandis Judaeis</i> (1619).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The hostility of the burgher class, which was made up of
Germans to a considerable extent, manifested itself with particular
intensity in the old hotbed of anti-Semitism, in Posen.
Attacks on the Jewish quarter on the part of the street mob and
"lawful" persecutions on the part of the magistracy and trade-unions
were a regular feature in the life of that city. In the
case of several trades, as, for instance, in the needle trade, the
Jewish artisans were restricted to Jewish customers. In 1618
a painter employed to paint the walls of the Posen town hall
drew all kinds of figures which were extremely offensive to the
Jews, and subjected them to the ridicule of an idle street mob.
Two years later the local clergy spread the rumor, that the
table on which the famous three hosts had been pierced by the
Jews in 1399<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> had been accidentally discovered in the house of
a Jew. The fictitious relic was transferred to the Church of
the Carmelites in a solemn procession, headed by the Bishop
and the whole local priesthood. This demonstration helped to
inflame the populace against the Jews. The crowd, fed on
such spectacles, lost the last sparks of humanity. The scholars
of the Jesuit colleges frequently invaded the Jewish quarter,
making sport of the Jews and committing all kinds of excesses,
in strange contradiction to the precept of the Gospels,
to love their enemies, which they were taught in their schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Based on malicious fabrications, ritual murder trials become
endemic during this period, and assume an ominous, inquisitorial
character. Cases of this nature are given great prominence,
and are tried by the highest Polish law court, the Crown
Tribunal,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> without any of the safeguards of impartiality which
had been provided for such cases by the ancient charters of the
Polish kings, and had been more recently reaffirmed by Stephen
Batory. In 1598 the Tribunal of Lublin sentenced three
Jews to death on the charge of having slain a Christian boy,
whose body had been found in a swamp in a near-by village. To
force a confession from the accused the whole inquisitorial torture
apparatus was set in motion, and execution by quartering
was carried out with special solemnity in Lublin. The body
of the youngster, the involuntary cause of the death of innocent
victims, was transferred by the Jesuits to one of the local
churches, where it became the object of superstitious veneration.
Trials of this kind, with an occasional change of scene, were
enacted in many other localities of Poland and Lithuania.</p>

<p>Simultaneously a literary agitation against the Jews was set
on foot by the clerical party. Father Moyetzki published in
1598 in Cracow his ferociously anti-Jewish book entitled
"Jewish Bestiality" (<i>Okrucieństwo Żydowskie</i>), enumerating
all ritual murder trials which had ever taken place in Europe
and particularly in Poland, and adding others which were
invented for this purpose by the author.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>A Polish physician, named Shleshkovski, accused the Jewish
physicians, his professional rivals, of systematically poisoning
and delivering to death good Catholics, and declared the pest,
raging at that time, to be a token of the Divine displeasure
at the protection granted to the Jews in Poland (<i>Jasny dowód
o doktorach żydowskich</i>, "A Clear Argument Concerning Jewish
Physicians," 1623).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>But the palm undoubtedly belongs to Sebastian Michinski,
of Cracow, the frenzied author of the "Mirror of the Polish
Crown" (<i>Zwierciadlo korony Polskiej</i>, 1618). As a docile
pupil of the Jesuits, Michinski collected everything that superstition
and malice had ever invented against the Jews. He
charged the Jews with every mortal sin&mdash;with political treachery,
robbery, swindling, witchcraft, murder, sacrilege. In this
scurrilous pamphlet he calls upon the deputies of the Polish
Diet to deal with the Jews as they had been dealt with in Spain,
France, England, and other countries&mdash;to expel them. In
particular, the book is full of libels against the rich Jews of
Cracow, with the result that the sentiment against the Jewish
population of that city rapidly drifted towards a riot. To forestall
the possibility of excesses the King ordered the confiscation
of the book. The incendiary attacks of Michinski also led to
stormy debates at the Diet of 1618. While some deputies eulogized
him as a champion of truth, others denounced him as a
demagogue and a menace to the public welfare. The Diet
showed enough common sense to refuse to follow the lead
of a writer crazed with Jew-hatred; yet the opinions voiced
by him gradually took hold of the Polish people, and prepared
the soil for sinister conflicts.</p>

<p>Sigismund III.'s successor, Vladislav IV., was not so zealous
in his Catholicism and in his devotion to the Jesuits as his
father. He exhibited a certain amount of tolerance towards
the professors of other creeds, endeavored to uphold the ancient
Jewish privileges, and made it, in general, his business to
reconcile the warring estates with one another. However, the
strife between the religious and social groups had already eaten
so deeply into the vitals of Poland that even a far more energetic
king than Vladislav IV. would scarcely have been able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
put an end to it. Instead of harmonizing the conflicting
interests, the King sided now with one, now with another, party.
In 1633 Vladislav IV. confirmed, at the Coronation Diet,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> the
basic privileges of the Jews, granting them full freedom in their
export trade, fixing the limits of their judicial autonomy, and
instructing the municipalities to take measures for shielding
them against popular outbreaks. But at the same time he
forbade the Jewish communities to erect new synagogues or
establish new cemeteries, without obtaining in each case a royal
license. This restriction, by the way, may be considered
a privilege, inasmuch as an attempt had been made by Sigismund
III. to make the right of erecting synagogues dependent
on the consent of the clergy.</p>

<p>Though on the whole desirous of respecting the rights of
the Jews, nevertheless, in individual cases, the King acted
favorably on the petitions of various cities to restrict these
rights, and occasionally revoked his own orders. Thus in June,
1642, he permitted the Jews of Cracow to engage freely in
export trade, but two months later he withdrew his permission,
the Christian merchants of Cracow having complained to him
about the effectiveness of Jewish competition. Complying with
the application of the burghers of Moghilev on the Dnieper,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
he confirmed, in 1633, his father's orders concerning the transfer
of the Jews from the center of the city to its outskirts, and
subsequently, in 1646, sanctioned the decision of the magistracy
prohibiting the letting of houses to them in a Christian neighborhood.
The law forbidding Jews to engage in petty trade
on the market-place effected in some cities a substantial rise
in the prices of necessaries, and the Shlakhta petitioned the
King to repeal this prohibition for the city of Vilna. Vladislav
complied with the petition, but, to please the Vilna municipality,
he imposed at the same time a number of severe
restrictions on the local Jews, making them liable to the
municipal courts in monetary litigation with Christians, confining
their area of residence to the boundaries of the "Jewish
street," and barring them from plying those trades which were
pursued by the Christian trade-unions (1633). The same
policy was responsible for the anti-Jewish riots which took
place about the same time in Vilna, Brest, and other cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing did more to accentuate these conflicts than the preposterous
economic policy of the Polish Government. The
Warsaw Diet of 1643, in endeavoring to determine the prices
of various articles of merchandise, passed a law compelling all
merchants to limit themselves by a public oath to a definite
rate of profit, which was fixed at seven per cent in the case of the
native Christian (<i>incola</i>), five per cent in the case of the
foreigner (<i>advena</i>), and only three per cent in the case of the
Jew (<i>infidelis</i>). It is obvious that, being under the compulsion
of selling his goods at a cheaper price, the Jew on the
one hand was forced to lower the quality of his merchandise,
and on the other hand was bound to undermine Christian
trade, and thereby draw upon himself the wrath of his competitors.</p>

<p>As for the Polish clergy, true to its old policy it fostered
in its flock the vulgar religious prejudices against the Jews.
This applies, in particular, to the Jesuits, though, to a lesser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
degree, it holds good also in the case of the other Catholic
orders of Poland. A frequent contrivance to raise the prestige
of the Church was to engineer impressive demonstrations. In
the spring of 1636, when a Christian child happened to disappear
in Lublin, suspicion was cast upon the Jews, that they
had tortured the child to death. The Crown Tribunal, which
tried the case, and failed to find any evidence, acquitted the
innocent Jews. Thereupon the local clergy, dissatisfied with
the judgment of the court, manufactured a new case, this
time with the necessary "evidence." A Carmelite monk by
the name of Peter asserted that the Jews, having lured him
into a house, told a German surgeon to bleed him, and that his
blood was squeezed out and poured into a vessel, while the Jews
murmured mysterious incantations over it. The Tribunal gave
credit to this hideous charge, and, after going through the
regular legal proceedings, including the medieval "cross-examinations"
and the rack, sentenced one Jew named Mark
(Mordecai) to death. The Carmelite monks hastened to advertise
the case for the purpose of planting the terrible prejudice
more firmly in the hearts of the people.</p>

<p>Another trial of a similar nature took place in 1639. Two
elders of the Jewish community of Lenchitza were sentenced to
death by the Crown Tribunal on the charge of having murdered
a Christian boy from a neighboring village. Neither the protestation
of the Starosta of Lenchitza, that the case did not
come within the jurisdiction of his court, nor the fact that the
accused, though put upon the rack, refused to make a confession,
were able to avert the death sentence. The bodies of the
executed Jews were cut into pieces and hung on poles at the
cross-roads. The Bernardine monks of Lenchitza turned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
incident to good account by placing the remains of the supposedly
martyred boy in their church and putting up a picture
representing all the details of the murder. The superstitious
Catholic masses flocked to the church to worship at the shrine
of the juvenile saint, swelling the revenues of the Bernardine
church&mdash;which was exactly what the devout monks were after.</p>

<p>While the Church was engineering the ritual murder trials
for the sake of "business," the municipal agencies, representing
the Christian merchant class, acted similarly for the purpose
of ridding themselves of the Jews and getting trade under
their absolute control. This policy is luridly illustrated by a
tragic occurrence, which, in the years 1635 to 1637, stirred the
city of Cracow to its depths. A Pole by the name of Peter
Yurkevich was convicted of having stolen some church
vessels. At the cross-examination, having been put upon the
rack, he testified that a Jewish tailor, named Jacob Gzheslik,
had persuaded him to steal a host. Since the Jew had disappeared
and could nowhere be found, Yurkevich was the only
one to bear the death penalty. But before the execution, in
making his confession to the priest, he stated&mdash;and he repeated
the statement afterwards before an official committee of investigation&mdash;the
following facts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have stolen no sacraments from any church, and have never
made my God an object of barter. I merely stole a few silver and
other church dishes. My former depositions were made at the
advice of the gentlemen of the magistracy. The first time I was
conducted into the court room Judge Belza spoke to me as follows:
"Depose that you have stolen the sacraments and sold them to the
Jews. You will suffer no harm from it, while we shall have a
weapon wherewith to expel the Jews from Cracow." I had hoped
that this deposition would obtain freedom for me, and I did as I
had been told.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>But Yurkevich's statement had no effect. He was convicted
on the strength of his original affidavit, though it had
been squeezed out of him by trickery and torture, and he
was burned at the stake. As for the Jews of Cracow, they had
to bear the penalty in the shape of a riot, the mob attacking
the Jewish ghetto and seizing forty Jews, who were carried off
to be thrown into the river. Seven men were drowned, while
the others saved themselves by promising to embrace Christianity
(May, 1637).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
THE INNER LIFE OF POLISH JEWRY AT ITS
ZENITH</h2>


<p>1. <span class="smcap">Kahal Autonomy and the Jewish Diets</span></p>

<p>The peculiar position occupied by the Jews in Poland made
their social autonomy both necessary and possible. Constituting
an historical nationality, with an inner life of its own,
the Jews were segregated by the Government as a separate
estate, an independent social body. Though forming an integral
part of the urban population, the Jews were not officially
included in any one of the general urban estates, whose affairs
were administered by the magistracy or the trade-unions.
Nor were they subjected to the jurisdiction of Christian law
courts as far as their internal affairs were concerned. They
formed an entirely independent class of citizens, and as such
were in need of independent agencies of self-government and
jurisdiction. The Jewish community constituted not only a
national and cultural, but also a civil, entity. It formed a
Jewish city within a Christian city, with its separate forms of
life, its own religious, administrative, judicial, and charitable
institutions. The Government of a country with sharply
divided estates could not but legalize the autonomy of the
Jewish Kahal, after having legalized the Magdeburg Law of
the Christian urban estates, in which the Germans constituted
the predominating element. As for the kings, in their capacity
as the official "guardians" of the Jews, they were especially
concerned in having the Kahals properly organized, since the
regular payment of the Jewish taxes was thereby assured.
Moreover, the Government found it more to its convenience to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
deal with a well-defined body of representatives than with the
unorganized masses.</p>

<p>As early as the period of royal "paternalism," during the
reign of Sigismund I., the king endeavored to extend his
fatherly protection to the Jewish system of communal self-government.
The appointment of Michael Yosefovich as the
"senior" of the Lithuanian Jews, with a rabbi as expert
adviser<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>, was designed to safeguard the interests of the exchequer
by concentrating the power in the hands of a federation
of Kahals in Lithuania. On more than one occasion
Sigismund I. confirmed the "spiritual judges," or rabbis
(<i>judices spirituales</i>, <i>doctores legis</i>), elected by the Jews in
different parts of Poland, in their office. In 1518 he ratified,
at the request of the Jews of Posen, their election of two leading
rabbis, Moses and Mendel, to the posts of provincial judges
for all the communities of Great Poland, bestowing upon the
newly-elected officials the right of instructing and judging
their coreligionists in accordance with the Jewish law. In
Cracow, where the Jews were divided into two separate communities&mdash;one
of native Polish Jews and another of immigrants
from Bohemia,&mdash;the King empowered each of them to
elect its own rabbi. The choice fell upon Rabbi Asher for the
former, and upon Rabbi Peretz for the latter, community, and
when a dispute arose between the two communities as to the
ownership of the old synagogue, the King again intervened, and
decided the case in favor of the native community (1519).
In 1531 Mendel Frank, the rabbi of Brest, complained to the
King that the Jews did not always respect his decisions, and
brought their cases before the royal starostas. Accordingly
Sigismund I. thought it necessary to warn the Jews to submit
to the jurisdiction of their own "doctors," or rabbis, who dispensed
justice according to the "Jewish law," and were given
the right of imposing the "oath" (<i>herem</i>, excommunication)
and all kinds of other penalties upon insubordinates. In the
following year the King appointed as "senior," or chief rabbi,
of Cracow the well-known scholar Moses Fishel&mdash;who, it may
be added parenthetically, had taken the degree of Doctor of
Medicine in Padua&mdash;to succeed Rabbi Asher, referred to previously.
Pursuing the same policy of centralization, the King,
a few years later, in 1541, confirmed in their office as chief
rabbis (<i>seniores</i>) of the whole province of Little Poland two
men "learned in the Jewish law," the same Rabbi Moses
Fishel of Cracow, and the famous progenitor of Polish Talmudism,
Rabbi Shalom Shakhna of Lublin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>In the same measure, however, in which the communal organization
of the Jews gained in strength, and the functions
of the rabbis and Kahal elders became more clearly defined,
the Government gradually receded from its attitude of paternal
interference. The <i>magna charta</i> of Jewish autonomy may be
said to be represented by the charter of Sigismund Augustus,
issued on August 13, 1551, which embodies the fundamental
principles of self-government for the Jewish communities of
Great Poland.</p>

<p>According to this charter, the Jews are entitled to elect, by
general agreement,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> their own rabbis and "lawful judges" to
take charge of their spiritual and social affairs. The rabbis
and judges, elected in this manner, are authorized to expound
all questions of the religious ritual, to perform marriages and
grant divorces, to execute the transfer of property and other
acts of a civil character, and to settle disputes between Jews in
accordance with the "Mosaic law" (<i>iuxta ritum et morem
legis illorum Mosaicae</i>) and the supplementary Jewish legislation.
In conjunction with the Kahal elders they are empowered
to subject offenders against the law to excommunication
and other punishments, such as the Jewish customs may
prescribe. In case the person punished in this manner does not
recant within a month, the matter is to be brought to the
knowledge of the king, who may sentence the incorrigible malefactor
to death and confiscate his property. The local officers
of the king are enjoined to lend their assistance in carrying
out the orders of the rabbis and elders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>This enactment, coupled with a number of similar charters,
which were subsequently promulgated for various provinces of
Poland, conferred upon the elective representatives of the Jewish
communities extensive autonomy in economic and administrative
as well as judicial affairs, at the same time insuring
its practical realization by placing at its disposal the power of
the royal administration.</p>

<p>The firm consolidation of the <i>régime</i> of the self-governing
community, the <i>Kahal</i>, dates from that period. In this appellation
two concepts were merged: the "community," the
aggregate of the local Jews, on the one hand, and, on the other,
the "communal administration," representing the totality of
all the Jewish institutions of a given locality, including the
rabbinate. The activity of the Kahals assumed particularly
large proportions beginning with the latter half of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>All cities and towns with a Jewish population had their
separate Kahal boards. Their size corresponded roughly to
that of the given community. In large centers the membership<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of the Kahal board amounted to forty; in smaller towns
it was limited to ten. The members of the Kahal were elected
annually during the intermediate days of Passover. As a rule
the election proceeded according to a double-graded system.
Several electors (<i>borerim</i>), their number varying from nine
to five, were appointed by lot from among the members of all
synagogues, and these electors, after taking a solemn oath, chose
the Kahal elders. The elders were divided into groups.
Two of these, the <i>rashim</i> and <i>tubim</i> (the "heads" and
"optimates"), stood at the head of the administration, and
were in charge of the general affairs of the community. They
were followed by the <i>dayyanim</i>, or judges, and the <i>gabbaim</i>, or
directors, who managed the synagogues as well as the educational
and charitable institutions. The <i>rashim</i> and <i>tubim</i>
formed the nucleus of the Kahal, seven of them making a
quorum; in the smaller communities they were practically
identical with the Kahal board.</p>

<p>The sphere of the Kahal's activity was very large. Within
the area allotted to it the Kahal collected and turned over
to the exchequer the state taxes, arranged the assessment
of imposts, both of a general and a special character, took charge
of the synagogues, the Talmudic academies, the cemeteries,
and other communal institutions. The Kahal executed title-deeds
on real estate, regulated the instruction of the young,
organized the affairs appertaining to charity and to commerce
and handicrafts, and with the help of the <i>dayyanim</i> and the
rabbi settled disputes between the members of the community.
As for the rabbi, while exercising unrestricted authority in
religious affairs, he was in all else dependent on the Kahal
board, which invited him to his post for a definite term. Only
great authorities, far-famed on account of their Talmudic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
erudition, were able to assert their influence in all departments
of communal life.</p>

<p>The Kahal of each city extended its authority to the adjacent
settlements and villages which did not possess autonomous
organizations of their own. Moreover, the Kahals of the large
centers kept under their jurisdiction the minor Kahals, or
<i>prikahalki</i>,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> as they were officially called, of the towns and
townlets of their district, as far as the apportionment of taxes
and the judicial authority were concerned. This gave rise to
the "Kahal boroughs," or <i>gheliloth</i> (singular, <i>galil</i>). Often
disputes arose between the Kahal boroughs as to the boundaries
of their districts, the contested minor communities submitting
now to this, now to the other, "belligerent." On the whole,
however, the moderate centralization of self-government benefited
the Jewish population, since it introduced order and discipline
into the Kahal hierarchy, and enabled it to defend the
civil and national interests of Judaism more effectively.</p>

<p>The capstone of this Kahal organization were the so-called
<i>Waads</i>,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> the conferences or assemblies of rabbis and Kahal
leaders. These conferences received their original impetus from
the rabbis and judges. The rabbinical law courts, officially
endowed with extensive powers, were guided in their decisions
by the legislation embodied in the Bible and the Talmud, which
made full provision for all questions of religious, civil, and
domestic life as well as for all possible infractions of the law.
Yet it was but natural that even in this extensive system of law
disputed points should arise for which the competency of a
single rabbi did not suffice. Moreover there were cases in
which the litigants appealed from the decision of one rabbinical
court to another, more authoritative, court. Finally lawsuits
would occasionally arise between groups of the population, between
one community and another, or between a private person
and a Kahal board. For such emergencies conferences of rabbis
and elders would be called from time to time as the highest
court of appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Beginning with the middle of the sixteenth century these
conferences met at the time of the great fairs, when large
numbers of people congregated from various places, and litigants
arrived in connection with their business affairs. The
chief meeting-place was the Lublin fair, owing to the fact that
Lublin was the residence of the father of Polish rabbinism,
the above-mentioned Rabbi Shalom Shakhna, who was officially
recognized as the "senior rabbi" of Little Poland. As far
back as in the reign of Sigismund I. the "Jewish doctors," or
rabbis, met there for the purpose of settling civil disputes
"according to their law." In the latter part of the sixteenth
century these conferences of rabbis and communal leaders,
assembling in connection with the Lublin fairs, became more
frequent, and led in a short time to the organization of regular,
periodic conventions, which were attended by representatives
from the principal Jewish communities of the whole of Poland.</p>

<p>The activity of these conferences, or conventions, passed,
by gradual expansion, from the judicial sphere into that of
administration and legislation. At these conventions laws were
adopted determining the order of Kahal elections, fixing the
competency of the rabbis and judges, granting permits for
publishing books, and so forth. Occasionally these assemblies
of Jewish notables endorsed by their authority the enactments
of the Polish Government. Thus, in 1580, the representatives
of the Polish-Jewish communities, who assembled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Lublin, gave their solemn sanction to the well-known Polish
law barring the Jews of the Crown, of Poland proper, from
farming state taxes and other public revenues, in view of
the fact that "certain people, thirsting for gain and wealth, to
be obtained from extensive leases, might thereby expose the
community to great danger."</p>

<p>Towards the end of the sixteenth century the fair conferences
received a firmer organization. They were attended by the
rabbis and Kahal representatives of the following provinces:
Great Poland (the leading community being that of Posen),
Little Poland (Cracow and Lublin), Red Russia (Lemberg),
Volhynia (Ostrog and Kremenetz), and Lithuania
(Brest and Grodno). Originally the name of the assembly
varied with the number of provinces represented in it, and it
was designated as the Council of the Three, or the Four, or
the Five, Lands. Subsequently, when Lithuania withdrew
from the Polish Kahal organization, establishing a federation
of its own, and the four provinces of the Crown<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> began to send
their delegates regularly to these conferences, the name of the
assembly was ultimately fixed as "the Council of the Four
Lands" (<i>Waad Arba Aratzoth</i>).</p>

<p>The "Council" was made up of several leading rabbis of
Poland,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and of one delegate for each of the principal Kahals
selected from among their elders&mdash;the number of the conferees
altogether amounting to about thirty. They met
periodically, once or twice a year, in Lublin and Yaroslav
(Galicia) alternately. As a rule, the Council assembled in
Lublin in early spring, between Purim and Passover, and in
Yaroslav at the end of the summer, before the high holidays.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The representatives of the Four Lands&mdash;says a well-known
annalist of the first half of the seventeenth century<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>&mdash;reminded
one of the Sanhedrin, which in ancient days assembled in the
Chamber of Hewn Stones (<i>lishkath ha-gazith</i>) of the temple. They
dispensed justice to all the Jews of the Polish realm, issued preventive
measures and obligatory enactments (<i>takkanoth</i>), and
imposed penalties as they saw fit. All the difficult cases were
brought before their court. To facilitate matters the delegates of
the Four Lands appointed [a special commission of] so-called
"provincial judges" (<i>dayyane medinoth</i>) to settle disputes concerning
property, while they themselves [in plenary session] examined
criminal cases, matters appertaining to <i>hazaka</i> (priority of
possession) and other difficult points of law.</p></div>

<p>The Council of the Four Lands was the guardian of Jewish
civil interests in Poland. It sent its <i>shtadlans</i><a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> to the residential
city of Warsaw<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and other meeting-places of the Polish
Diets for the purpose of securing from the king and his dignitaries
the ratification of the ancient Jewish privileges, which
had been violated by the local authorities, or of forestalling
contemplated restrictive laws and increased fiscal burdens for
the Jewish population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>But the main energy of the Waad was directed towards the
regulation of the inner life of the Jews. The statute of 1607,
framed, at the instance of the Waad, by Joshua Falk Cohen,
Rabbi of Lublin, is typical of this solicitude. The following
rules are prescribed for the purpose of fostering piety and commercial
integrity among the Jewish people: to pay special
attention to the observance of the dietary laws, to refrain from
adopting the Christian form of dress; not to drink wine with
Christians in the pot-houses, in order not to be classed among
the disreputable members of the community; to watch over
the chastity of Jewish women, particularly in the villages
where the Jewish arendars<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> with their families were isolated
in the midst of the Christian population. In the same statute
rules are also laid down tending to restrain the activities of
Jewish usurers and to regulate money credit in general.</p>

<p>In 1623 the Kahals of Lithuania withdrew from the federation
of the Four Lands, and established a provincial organization
of their own, which was centralized in the convention of
delegates from the three principal Kahals of Brest, Grodno, and
Pinsk. Subsequently, in 1652 and 1691, the Kahals of Vilna
and Slutzk were added. The Lithuanian assembly was generally
designated as the "Council of the Principal Communities
of the Province of Lithuania" (<i>Waad Kehilloth Rashioth di-Medinath
Lita</i>). The organic statute, framed by the first
Council, comprises many aspects of the social and spiritual life
of the Jews. It lays down rules concerning the mutual relationship
of the communities, the methods of apportioning the taxes
among them, the relations with the outside world (such as the
Polish Diets, the local authorities, the landed nobility, and the
urban estates), the elections of the Kahals, and the question of
popular education. The Lithuanian Waad met every three
years in various cities of Lithuania, but in cases of emergency
extraordinary conventions were called. During the first years
of its existence the Lithuanian Council was evidently subordinate
to that of Poland, but at a later date this dependence
ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>In this way both the Crown, or Poland proper, and Lithuania
had their communal federations with central administrative
agencies. As was pointed out previously, the Polish federation
was composed of four provinces. The individual Kahals,
which were the component parts of each of these four provinces,
held their own provincial assemblies, which stood in the same
relation to the Waad as the "Dietines," or provincial Diets,
of Poland, to the national Diet of the whole country.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Thus
the communities of Great Poland had their own Great-Polish
"Dietine," those of Volhynia their own Volhynian "Dietine,"
and so forth. The provincial Kahal conventions met for the
purpose of allotting the taxes to the individual communities
of a given province, in proportion to the size of its population,
or of electing delegates to the federated Council. These Jewish
Dietines acted as the intermediate agencies of self-government,
standing half-way between the individual Kahals on the one
hand and the general Waads of the Crown and of Lithuania
on the other.</p>

<p>This firmly-knit organization of communal self-government
could not but foster among the Jews of Poland a spirit of discipline
and obedience to the law. It had an educational effect
on the Jewish populace, which was left by the Government to
itself, and had no share in the common life of the country. It
provided the stateless nation with a substitute for national and
political self-expression, keeping public spirit and civic virtue
alive in it, and upholding and unfolding its genuine culture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>2. <span class="smcap">The Instruction of the Young</span></p>

<p>One of the mainstays of this genuine culture was the autonomous
school. The instruction of the rising generation was the
object of constant solicitude on the part of the Kahals and the
rabbis as well as the conventions and Councils. Elementary
and secondary education was centered in the <i>heders</i>, while
higher education was fostered in the <i>yeshibahs</i>. Attendance
at the heder was compulsory for all children of school age, approximately
from six to thirteen. The subjects of instruction
at these schools were the Bible in the original, accompanied by
a translation into the Judeo-German vernacular,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and the
easier treatises of the Talmud with commentaries. In some
heders the study of Hebrew grammar and the four fundamental
operations of arithmetic were also admitted into the curriculum.
The establishment of these heders was left to private
initiative, every <i>melammed</i>, or Jewish elementary teacher, being
allowed to open a heder for boys and to receive compensation
for his labors from their parents. Only the heders for poor
children or for orphans, the so-called <i>Talmud Torahs</i>, were
maintained by the community from public funds. Yet the
supervision of the Kahal extended not only to the public, but
also to the private, elementary schools. The Kahal prescribed
the curriculum of the heders, arranged examinations for the
scholars, fixed the remuneration of the teachers, determined the
hours of instruction (which were generally from eight to
twelve a day), and took charge of the whole school work, in
some places even appointing a sort of school board (<i>Hevrah
Talmud Torah</i>) from among its own members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>The higher Talmudic school or college, the yeshibah, was
entirely under the care of the Kahal and the rabbis. This
school, which provided a complete religious and juridical education
based on the Talmud and the rabbinical codes of law,
received the sanction of the Polish Government. King Sigismund
Augustus granted the Jewish community of Lublin
permission to open a yeshibah, or "gymnazium" (<i>gymnazium
ad instituendos homines illorum religionis</i>), with a synagogue
attached to it, bestowing upon its president, a learned rabbi,
not only the title of "rector," but also extensive powers over
the affairs of the community (1567). Four years later the
same King granted an even larger license to "the learned Solomon
of Lemberg, whom the Jewish community of Lemberg and
the whole land of Russia<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> have chosen for their 'senior doctor'
(<i>ab-beth-din</i>, or <i>rosh-yeshibah</i>)," conferring upon him the
right to open schools in various cities, "to train the students
in the sciences," to keep them under his control, and to inure
them to a strict discipline.</p>

<p>In the course of time Talmudic yeshibahs sprang up in all the
cities of Poland and Lithuania. The functions of rector, or
rosh-yeshibah, were performed either by the local rabbi or by
a man especially selected for this post on account of his learning.
It seems that the combination of the two offices of rabbi
and college president in one person was limited to those communities
in which the duties of the spiritual guide of the community
were not complex, and admitted of the simultaneous
discharge of pedagogic functions. In the large centers, however,
where the public responsibilities were regularly divided,
the rosh-yeshibah was an independent dignitary, who was
clothed with considerable authority. Similar to the contemporary
rectors of Jesuit colleges, the rosh-yeshibah was absolute
master within the school walls; he exercised unrestricted
control over his pupils, subjecting them to a well-established
discipline and dispensing justice among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>The contemporary chronicler quoted above, Rabbi Nathan
Hannover, of Zaslav, in Volhynia, portrays in vivid colors the
Jewish school life of Poland and Lithuania in the first half
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In no country&mdash;quoth Rabbi Nathan<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>&mdash;was the study of the
Torah so widespread among the Jews as in the Kingdom of Poland.
Every Jewish community maintained a yeshibah, paying its president
a large salary, so as to enable him to conduct the institution
without worry and to devote himself entirely to the pursuit of
learning.... Moreover, every Jewish community supported college
students (<i>bahurs</i>), giving them a certain amount of money
per week, so that they might study under the direction of the
president. Every one of these bahurs was made to instruct at
least two boys, for the purpose of deepening his own studies and
gaining some experience in Talmudic discussions. The [poor]
boys obtained their food either from the charity fund or from the
public kitchen. A community of fifty Jewish families would support
no less than thirty of these young men and boys, one family
supplying board for one college student and his two pupils, the
former sitting at the family table like one of the sons.... There
was scarcely a house in the whole Kingdom of Poland where the
Torah was not studied, and where either the head of the family
or his son or his son-in-law, or the yeshibah student boarding with
him, was not an expert in Jewish learning; frequently all of these
could be found under one roof. For this reason every community
contained a large number of scholars, a community of fifty families
having as many as twenty learned men, who were styled
<i>morenu</i><a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> or <i>haber</i>.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> They were all excelled by the rosh-yeshibah,
all the scholars submitting to his authority and studying under
him at the yeshibah.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The program of study in Poland was as follows: The scholastic
term during which the young men and the boys were obliged to
study under the rosh-yeshibah lasted from the beginning of the
month of Iyyar until the middle of Ab [approximately from April
until July] in the summer and from the first of the month of
Heshvan until the fifteenth of Shebat [October-June] in the winter.
Outside of these terms the young men and the boys were free to
choose their own place of study. From the beginning of the summer
term until Shabuoth and from the beginning of the winter
term until Hanukkah all the students of the yeshibah studied with
great intensity the Gemara [the Babylonian Talmud] and the commentaries
of Rashi<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and the Tosafists.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
<p>The scholars and young students of the community as well
as all interested in the study of the Law assembled daily at the
yeshibah, where the president alone occupied a chair, while
the scholars and college students stood around him. Before
the appearance of the rosh-yeshibah they would discuss questions
of Jewish law, and when he arrived every one laid his difficulties
before him, and received an explanation. Thereupon silence
was restored, and the rosh-yeshibah delivered his lecture, presenting
the new results of his study. At the conclusion of the
lecture he arranged a scientific argumentation (<i>hilluk</i>), proceeding
in the following way: Various contradictions in the Talmud and
the commentaries were pointed out, and solutions were proposed.
These solutions were, in turn, shown to be contradictory, and other
solutions were offered, this process being continued until the subject
of discussion was completely elucidated. These exercises
continued in summer at least until midday. From the middle of
the two scholastic terms until their conclusion the rosh-yeshibah
paid less attention to these argumentations, and read instead the
religious codes, studying with the mature scholars the <i>Turim</i><a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
with commentaries, and with the [younger] students the compendium
of Alfasi<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.... Several weeks before the close of the term
the rosh-yeshibah would honor the members of his college, both the
scholars and the students, by inviting them to conduct the scientific
disputations on his behalf, though he himself would participate
in the discussion in order to exercise the mental faculties of
all those attending the yeshibah.</p>

<p>Attached to the president of the yeshibah was an inspector, who
had the duty of visiting the elementary schools, or heders, daily,
and seeing to it that all boys, whether poor or rich, applied themselves
to study and did not loiter in the streets. On Thursdays
the pupils had to present themselves before the trustee (<i>gabbai</i>)
of the Talmud Torah, who examined them in what they had covered
during the week. The boy who knew nothing or who did not
answer adequately was by order of the trustee turned over to
the inspector, who subjected him, in the presence of his fellow-pupils,
to severe physical punishment and other painful
degradations, that he might firmly resolve to improve in his studies
during the following week. On Fridays the heder pupils presented
themselves in a body before the rosh-yeshibah himself, to undergo
a similar examination. This had a strong deterrent effect upon the
boys, and they devoted themselves energetically to their studies....
The scholars, seeing this [the honors showered upon the
rosh-yeshibah], coveted the same distinction, that of becoming a
rosh-yeshibah in some community. They studied assiduously in
consequence. Prompted originally by self-interest, they gradually
came to devote themselves to the Torah from pure, unselfish
motives.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>By way of contrast to this panegyric upon Polish-Jewish
school life, it is only fair that we should quote another contemporary,
who severely criticizes the methods of instruction
then in vogue at the yeshibahs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The whole instruction at the yeshibah&mdash;writes the well-known
preacher Solomon Ephraim of Lenchitza (d. 1619)<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>&mdash;reduces itself
to mental equilibristics and empty argumentations called hilluk.
It is dreadful to contemplate that some venerable rabbi, presiding
over a yeshibah, in his anxiety to discover and communicate to
others some new interpretation, should offer a perverted explanation
of the Talmud, though he himself and every one else be fully
aware that the true meaning is different. Can it be God's will
that we sharpen our minds by fallacies and sophistries, spending
our time in vain and teaching the listeners to do likewise? And
all this for the mere ambition of passing for a great scholar!...
I myself have more than once argued with the Talmudic celebrities
of our time, showing the need for abolishing the method of pilpul
and hilluk, without being able to convince them. This attitude can
only be explained by the eagerness of these scholars for honors and
rosh-yeshibah posts. These empty quibbles have a particularly
pernicious effect on our bahurs, for the reason that the bahur who
does not shine in the discussion is looked down upon as incapable,
and is practically forced to lay aside his studies, though he might
prove to be one of the best, if Bible, Mishnah, Talmud, and the
Codes were studied in a regular fashion. I myself have known
capable young men who, not having distinguished themselves in
pilpul, forfeited the respect of their fellow-students, and stopped
studying altogether after their marriage.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>Secular studies were not included in the curriculum of the
yeshibahs. The religious codes composed during that period
allow the study of "the other sciences" only "on occasion,"
and only to those who have completely mastered Talmudic and
rabbinic literature. Needless to say, no yeshibah student
could lay claim to such mastery until the completion of the
college course. Moreover, the secular sciences had to be
excluded from the yeshibah, for the external reason that
the latter was generally located in a sacred place, near the
synagogue, where the mere presence of a secular book was
regarded as a profanation. Yet it occasionally happened that
young men strayed away from the path of the Talmud, and
secretly indulged in the study of secular sciences and of Aristotelian
philosophy. This fact is attested by the great rabbinical
authority of the sixteenth century, Rabbi Solomon Luria. "I
myself"&mdash;he writes indignantly&mdash;"have seen the prayer of
Aristotle copied in the prayer-books of the bahurs." This
somewhat veiled expression indicates, in all likelihood, that
among the books of the yeshibah students "contraband" was
occasionally discovered, in the shape of manuscripts of philosophic
content. Unfortunately we hear nothing more definite
as to the way in which the Jewish youth of that period became
infatuated with anathematized philosophy. We have reason to
assume, however, that such deviations from the rigorous discipline
of rabbinical scholarship were few and far between.</p>

<p>The yeshibahs, providing as they did an academic training,
were the nurseries of that intellectual aristocracy which subsequently
became so powerful a factor in the life of Polish-Lithuanian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Jewry. This numerically considerable class of scholars
looked down upon the uneducated multitude. Yet the level of
literacy even among the latter was comparatively high. All
boys, without exception, attended the heder, where they studied
the Hebrew language and the Bible, while many devoted themselves
to the Talmud. A different attitude is observable towards
female education. Girls remained outside the school, their instruction
not being considered obligatory according to the
Jewish law. No heders for girls are mentioned in any of the
documents of the time. Nor did a single woman attain to literary
fame among the Jews of Poland and Lithuania. The girls
were taught at home to read the prayers, but they were seldom
instructed in the Hebrew language, so that the majority of
women had but a very imperfect notion of the meaning of the
prayers in the original. In consequence, the women began at
that time to use the translations of the prayers in the Jewish
vernacular, the so-called <i>Jüdisch-Deutsch</i>.</p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap">The High-Water Mark of Rabbinic Learning</span></p>

<p>The high intellectual level of the Polish Jews was the result
of their relative economic prosperity. As for the character of
their mental productivity, it was the direct outcome of their
social autonomy. The vast system of Kahal self-government
enhanced not only the authority of the rabbi, but also that of
the learned Talmudist and of every layman familiar with Jewish
law. The rabbi discharged, within the limits of his community,
the functions of spiritual guide, head of the yeshibah,
and inspector of elementary schools, as well as those of legislator
and judge. An acquaintance with the vast and complicated
Talmudic law was to a certain extent necessary even for
the layman who occupied the office of an elder (<i>parnas</i>, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
<i>rosh-ha-Kahal</i>), or was in some way connected with the scheme
of Jewish self-government. For the enactments of the Talmud
regulated the inner life of the Polish Jews in the same way as
they had done formerly in Babylonia, in the time of the autonomous
Exilarchs and Gaons. But it must be remembered that,
since the times of the Gaons, Jewish law had been considerably
amplified, Rabbinic Judaism having been superimposed
upon Talmudic Judaism. This mass of religious lore, which
had been accumulating for centuries, now monopolized the
minds of all educated Jews in the empire of Poland, which
thus became a second Babylonia. It reigned supreme in the
synagogues, the yeshibahs, and the elementary schools. It
gave tone to social and domestic life. It spoke through the
mouth of the judge, the administrator, and the communal
leader. Lastly it determined the content of Jewish literary
productivity. Polish-Jewish literature was almost exclusively
consecrated to rabbinic law.</p>

<p>The beginnings of Talmudic learning in Poland can be
traced back to the first half of the sixteenth century. It had
been carried thither from neighboring Bohemia, primarily from
the school of the originator of the pilpul method, Jacob Pollack.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
A pupil of the latter, Rabbi Shalom Shakhna (ab.
1500-1558), is regarded as one of the pioneers of Polish Talmudism.
All we know about his fortunes is that he lived and
died in Lublin, that in 1541 he was confirmed by a decree of
King Sigismund I. in the office of chief rabbi of Little Poland,
and that he stood at the head of the yeshibah which sent forth
the rabbinical celebrities of the following generation.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> It is
quite probable that the rabbinical conferences of Lublin, which
afterwards led to the formation of the "Council of the Four
Lands," owe their inception to the initiative of Rabbi Shakhna.
After his death his son Israel succeeded to the post of chief
rabbi in Lublin. But it was a pupil of Shakhna, Moses Isserles,
known in literature by the abbreviated name of ReMO (1520-1572),<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
who became famous throughout the entire Jewish
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Moses Isserles, the son of a well-to-do Kahal elder in Cracow,
became prominent in the rabbinical world early in life.
He occupied the post of a member of the Jewish communal
court in his native city, and stood at the head of the yeshibah.
This combination of scholarly and practical activities prompted
him to delve deep in the existing rabbinical codes, and he
found, as a result of his investigation, that they were not
exhaustive, and were in need of amplification.</p>

<p>Isserles was not even satisfied with the thoroughgoing elaboration
of Jewish law which had been undertaken by his Palestinian
contemporary Joseph Caro. When, in the middle of the
sixteenth century, Caro's comprehensive commentary on the
Code <i>Turim</i>,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> entitled <i>Beth-Yoseph</i> ("House of Joseph"),
appeared, Isserles composed a commentary on the same code
under the name <i>Darkhe Moshe</i> ("Ways of Moses"), in which
he considerably enlarged the legal material collected there,
drawing from sources which Caro had left out of consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>When, a few years later, the latter published his own code,
under the name of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> ("The Dressed Table"),
Isserles called attention to the fact that its author, being a
Sephardic Jew, had failed in many cases to utilize the investigations
of the rabbinic authorities among the Ashkenazim,
and had left out of consideration the local religious customs, or
<i>minhagim</i>, which were current among various groups of
German-Polish Jewry. These omissions were carefully noted
and supplied by Isserles. He supplemented the text of the
<i>Shulhan Arukh</i> by a large number of new laws, which he had
framed on the basis of the above-mentioned popular customs
or of the religious and legal practice of the Ashkenazic rabbis.
Caro's code having been named by the author "The Dressed
Table," Isserles gave his supplements thereto the title "Table-cloth"
(<i>Mappa</i>).<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> In this supplemented form the <i>Shulhan
Arukh</i> was introduced, as a code of Jewish rabbinic law, into
the religious and everyday life of the Polish Jews. The first
edition of this combined code of Caro and Isserles appeared in
Cracow in 1578, followed by numerous reprints, which testify
to the extraordinary popularity of the work.</p>

<p>The <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> became the substructure for the further
development of Polish rabbinism. Only very few scholars of
consequence had the courage to challenge the authority of this
generally acknowledged code of laws. One of these courageous
men was the contemporary and correspondent of Isserles, Solomon
Luria, known by the abbreviated name of ReSHaL<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
(ab. 1510-1573). Solomon Luria was a native of Posen,
whither his grandfather had immigrated from Germany. Endowed
with a subtle, analytic mind, Luria was a determined
opponent of the new school dialectics (pilpul), taking for his
model the old casuistic method of the Tosafists,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> which consisted
in a detailed criticism and an ingenious analysis of the
Talmudic texts. In this spirit he began to compose his remarkable
commentary on the Talmud (<i>Yam shel Shelomo</i>,
"Sea of Solomon"<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>), but succeeded in interpreting only a
few tractates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>In all his investigations Luria manifested boldness of
thought and independence of judgment, without sparing the
authorities whenever he believed them to be in the wrong.
Of the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and its author Luria spoke slightingly,
claiming that Joseph Caro had used his sources without the
necessary discrimination, and had decided many moot points of
law arbitrarily. In consequence of this independence of judgment,
Solomon Luria had many enemies in the scholarly world,
but he had, on the other hand, many enthusiastic admirers and
devoted disciples. In the middle of the sixteenth century he
occupied the post of rabbi in the city of Ostrog, in Volhynia.
By his Talmudic lectures, which attracted students from the
whole region, he made this city the intellectual center of Volhynian
and Lithuanian Jewry. The last years of his life he
spent in Lublin, where to this day there exists a synagogue
which bears his name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Luria and Isserles were looked upon as the pillars of Polish
rabbinism. Questions of Jewish ritual and law were submitted
to them for decision, not only from various parts of their own
country but also from Western Europe, from Italy, Germany,
and Bohemia. Their replies to these inquiries, or "Responsa"
(<i>Shaaloth u-Teshuboth</i>), have been gathered in special collections.
These two rabbis also carried on a scientific correspondence
with each other. As a result of their divergent character and
trend of mind, heated discussions frequently took place between
them. Thus Luria, in spite of all his sobriety of intellect,
gravitated towards the Cabala, while Isserles, with all his rabbinic
conservatism, devoted part of his leisure to philosophy.
The two scholars rebuked each other for their respective
"weaknesses." Luria maintained that the wisdom of the
"uncircumcised Aristotle" could be of no benefit, while
Isserles tried to prove that many views of the Cabala were not
in accord with the ideas of the Talmud, and that mysticism was
more dangerous to faith than a moderate philosophy.</p>

<p>Isserles was right. The philosophy with which he occupied
himself could scarcely be destructive of Orthodoxy. This is
shown by his large work <i>Torath ha-`Olah</i> ("The Law of the
Burnt-Offering," 1570),<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> which represents a weird mixture of
religious and philosophic discussions on themes borrowed from
Maimonides' "Guide of the Perplexed," interspersed with
speculations about the various classes of angels or the architecture
of the Jerusalem temple, its vessels and order of sacrifices.
The author professes to detect in all the details of the temple
service a profound symbolism. Notwithstanding the strange
plan of the book there are many chapters in it that show the
intimate familiarity of Isserles with the philosophic literature
of the Sephardim, a remarkable record for an Ashkenazic
rabbi of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>The intimate connection between rabbinic learning and Jewish
life stood out in bold relief from the moment the "Council
of the Four Lands" began to discharge its regular functions.
The Council had frequent occasion to decide, for practical
purposes, complicated questions appertaining to domestic,
civil, and criminal law, or relating to legal procedure and
religious practice, and the rabbis who participated in these
conferences as legal experts were forced to accomplish a
large amount of concrete, tangible work for themselves and
their colleagues. Questions of law and ritual were everywhere
assiduously investigated and elaborated, with that subtle
analysis peculiar to the Jewish mind, which pursues every
idea to its remotest consequences and its most trifling details.</p>

<p>The subject as well as the method of investigation depended,
as a rule, on the social position of the investigator. The rabbis
of higher rank, who took an active part in the Kahal administration,
and participated in the meetings of the Councils, either
of the Crown or of Lithuania, paid particular attention to the
practical application of Talmudic law. One of the oldest
scholars of this category during the period under discussion
was Mordecai Jaffe (died 1612), a native of Bohemia, who
occupied the post of rabbi successively in Grodno, Lublin,
Kremenetz, Prague, and Posen. Towards the end of the sixteenth
century he presided a number of times over the conferences
of the "Council of the Four Lands." Though a pupil
of Moses Isserles, Jaffe did not consider the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>
as supplemented by his teacher the last word in codification.
He objected to the fact that its juridical conclusions were
formulated dogmatically, without sufficient motivation.</p>

<p>For this reason he undertook the composition of a new and
more elaborate code of laws, arranged in the accepted order of
the four books of the <i>Turim</i>,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> which is known as <i>Lebushim</i>, or
"Raiments."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The method of Mordecai Jaffe differs from
that of Joseph Caro and Isserles in the wealth of the scientific
discussions which accompany every legal clause. At first
Jaffe's code created a split in the rabbinical world, and
threatened to weaken the authority of the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>.
In the end, however, the latter prevailed, and was acknowledged
as the only authoritative guide for the religious and juridical
practice of Judaism. Apart from his code, Mordecai Jaffe
wrote, under the same general title <i>Lebushim</i>, five more
volumes, containing Bible commentaries, synagogue sermons,
and annotations to Maimonides' "Guide," as well as Cabalistic
speculations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Jaffe's successor as leading rabbi and president of the
"Council of the Four Lands" was, in all likelihood, Joshua
Falk Cohen (died 1616), Rabbi of Lublin and subsequently
rector of the Talmudic yeshibah in Lemberg. He attained to
fame through his commentary to the <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i>, the part
of Caro's code dealing with civil law,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> which he called <i>Sepher
Meïrath `Enaïm</i>, "A Book of the Enlightenment of the Eyes"<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
(abbreviated to SeM`A). He also framed, at the instance of
the Waad, a large part of the above-mentioned regulations of
1607,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> which were issued for the purpose of establishing piety
and good morals more firmly among the Jews of Poland.</p>

<p>A more scholastic and less practical tendency is noticeable
in the labors of Joshua Falk's contemporary, Meïr of Lublin
(1554-1616), known by the abbreviated name of MaHaRaM.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
He was active as rabbi in Cracow, Lemberg, and Lublin, delivered
Talmudic discourses before large audiences, wrote ingenious,
casuistic commentaries to the most important treatises
of the Talmud (entitled <i>Meïr `Ene Hahamim</i>, "Enlightening
the Eyes of the Wise"), and was busy replying to the numerous
inquiries addressed to him by scholars from all parts (<i>Shaaloth
u-Teshuboth Maharam</i>). Laying particular stress on subtle
analysis, Rabbi Meïr of Lublin looked down upon the codifiers
and systematic writers of the class to which Isserles and
Jaffe belonged. The trifling minuteness of his investigations
may be illustrated by the fact that he considered it
necessary to write a special "opinion" about the question
whether a woman is guilty of conjugal infidelity, if she is
convicted of having had relations with the devil, the latter
having visited her first in the shape of her husband and afterwards
in the disguise of a Polish nobleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>In the domain of dialectics Rabbi Meïr found a successful
rival in the person of Samuel Edels, known by the abbreviated
name of MaHaRSHO<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> (died 1631), who occupied the post
of rabbi in Posen, Lublin, and Ostrog. In his comprehensive
expositions to all the sections of the Talmudic Halakha (<i>Hiddushe
Halakhoth</i>, "Novel Expositions of the Halakha"), he
endeavored principally to exercise the thinking faculties and
the memory of his students by an ingenious comparison of
texts and by other scholastic intricacies. The dialectic commentary
of Edels became one of the most important handbooks
for the study of the Talmud in the heders and yeshibahs,
and is frequently used there in our own days. His commentary
on the Talmudic Haggada is strewn over with Cabalistic and
religio-philosophic ideas of the conservative Jewish thinkers of
the Middle Ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>In the middle of the seventeenth century the authority of the
<i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, as edited by Isserles, had been so firmly established
in Poland that this code was studied and expounded with
even greater zeal than the Talmud. Joel Sirkis (died 1640)
delivered lectures on Jewish Law on the basis of the <i>Turim</i>
and the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>. He wrote a commentary to the
former under the name of <i>Beth Hadash</i> ("New House," abbreviated
to BaH), and published a large number of opinions on
questions of religious law. He held the Cabala in esteem, while
condemning philosophy violently. His younger contemporaries
devoted themselves exclusively to the exposition of the
<i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, particularly to the section called <i>Yore De`a</i>,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
dealing with the Jewish ritual, such as the religious customs of
the home, the dietary laws, etc. Two elaborate commentaries
to the <i>Yore De`a</i> appeared in 1646, the one composed by David
Halevi, rabbi in Lemberg and Ostrog, under the title <i>Ture
Zahab</i>,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and the other written by the famous Vilna scholar
Sabbatai Kohen, under the name <i>Sifthe Kohen</i> ("Lips of
the Priest").<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> These two commentaries, known by their
abbreviated titles of TaZ and ShaK, have since that time been
published together with the text of the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>This literary productivity was largely stimulated by the
rapid growth of Jewish typography in Poland. The first Jewish
book printed in that country is the Pentateuch (Cracow,
1530). In the second half of the sixteenth century two
large printing-presses, those of Cracow and Lublin, were active
in publishing a vast number of old and new books from the
domain of Talmudic, Rabbinic, and popular-didactic literature.
In 1566 King Sigismund Augustus granted Benedict Levita,
of Cracow, the monopoly of importing into Poland Jewish
books from abroad. Again, in 1578, Stephen Batory bestowed
on a certain Kalman the right of printing Jewish books in Lublin,
owing to the difficulty of importing them from abroad.
One of the causes of this intensified typographic activity in
Poland was the papal censorship of the Talmud, which was
established in Italy in 1564. From that time the printing-offices
of Cracow and Lublin competed successfully with the
technically perfected printing-presses of Venice and Prague,
and the Polish book-market, as a result, was more and more
dominated by local editions.</p>


<p>4. <span class="smcap">Secular Sciences, Philosophy, Cabala, and
Apologetics</span></p>

<p>The Talmudic and Rabbinic science of law, absorbing as it
did the best mental energies of Polish Jewry, left but little
room for the other branches of literary endeavor. Among the
daring "swimmers in the Talmudic ocean," contending for
mastery in erudition and dialectic skill, there were but few
with deeper spiritual longings who evinced an interest in
questions of philosophy and natural science. The only exceptions
were the physicians, who, on account of their profession,
received a secular education at the universities of that period.</p>

<p>Originally the Jewish physicians of Poland were natives
either of Spain, whence they had been expelled in 1492, or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Italy, being in the latter case graduates of the Catholic
University of Padua. Several of these foreign medical men
became the body-physicians of Polish kings, such as Isaac
Hispanus under John Albrecht and Alexander; Solomon Ashkenazi
(who subsequently was physician and diplomat at
the court of the Turkish Sultan Selim II.) under King Sigismund
Augustus; Solomon Calahora under Stephen Batory,
and others. But as early as the first part of the sixteenth century
these foreigners were rivaled by native Jewish physicians,
who traveled from Poland to Padua for the special purpose of
receiving a medical training. Such was, for example, the case
in 1530 with Moses Fishel, of Cracow, who was at once rabbi
and physician. These trips to Italy became very frequent
in the second part of the sixteenth century, and the number of
Polish Jewish students in Padua was on the increase down
to the eighteenth century. It is characteristic that the Christian
Poles studying in Padua refused to enter their Jewish
compatriots upon their "national register," in order, as is
stated in their statutes, "not to mar the memory of so many
celebrated men by the name of an infidel" (1654). In the
university registers the Jewish students appeared as <i>Hebraei
Poloni</i>.</p>

<p>As for religious philosophy, which was then on the wane in
Western Europe, it formed in Poland merely the object of
amateurish exercises on the part of several representatives of
Rabbinic learning. Moses Isserles and Mordecai Jaffe commented,
as was pointed out above, on the "Guide" of Maimonides
in a superficial manner, fighting shy of its inconvenient
rationalistic deductions. The favorite book of the theologians
of that period was <i>Ikkarim</i> ("Principles"), the system of
dogmatic Judaism formulated by the conservative Sephardic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
thinker Joseph Albo. Commentaries to this book were written
by Jacob Koppelman, of Brest-Kuyavsk<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> (<i>Ohel Ya`kob</i>, "Tent
of Jacob,"<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Cracow, 1599), and Gedaliah Lifshitz, of Lublin
(<i>Etz Shathul</i>, "Planted Tree,"<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> 1618). The former, a lover
of mathematics, loaded his commentary with geometrical and
astronomical arguments, being of the opinion that it was possible
in this way to prove scientifically the existence of God and
the correlation of all phenomena. The latter was more inclined
towards metaphysics and morals. How far this commentator
was from grasping the true meaning of the original may
be seen from his annotations to the introductory theses of
the book. Commenting on the passage in which Albo states
that "the happiness of man depends on the perfection of his
thought and conduct," Lifshitz makes the following observation:
"By human happiness is understood the <i>life beyond the
grave</i>, for the goal of man in this world consists only in the
attainment of eternal bliss after death."</p>

<p>In this way the Polish rabbis fashioned philosophy after their
own pattern, and thereby rendered it "harmless." Free research
was impossible, and perhaps not unattended by danger
in an environment where tradition reigned supreme. The
Chief Rabbi of Cracow, the above-mentioned Joel Sirkis, expressed
the view that philosophy was the mother of all heresies,
and that it was the "harlot" of which the wise king had said,
"None that go unto her return again" (Proverbs ii. 19).
He who becomes infatuated with philosophy and neglects the
secret wisdom of the Cabala is liable, in Sirkis' opinion, to
excommunication, and has no place among the faithful. The
well-known mathematician and philosopher Joseph Solomon
Delmedigo (called in abbreviated form "YaSHaR of Candia"<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>)
who spent nearly four years in Poland and Lithuania
(1620-1624), arraigns the Polish Jews for their opposition to
the secular sciences:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Behold&mdash;he says in Biblical phraseology<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>&mdash;darkness covereth the
earth, and the ignorant are numerous. For the breadth of thy
land is full of yeshibahs and houses of Talmud study.... [The
Jews of Poland] are opposed to the sciences,... saying, The Lord
hath no delight in the sharpened arrows of the grammarians, poets,
and logicians, nor in the measurements of the mathematicians and
the calculations of the astronomers.</p></div>

<p>The Cabala, which might be designated as an Orthodox
counter-philosophy, made constant progress in Poland. The
founder of the Polish Cabala was Mattathiah Delacruta, a
native of Italy, who lived in Cracow. In 1594 he published in
that city the system of Theoretic Cabala, entitled "Gates of
Light" (<i>Sha`are Ora</i>), by a Sephardic writer of the fourteenth
century, Joseph Gicatilla, accompanying it by an elaborate
commentary of his own. Delacruta was, as far as the subject of
the "hidden science" was concerned, the teacher of the versatile
Rabbi Mordecai Jaffe, who, in turn, wrote a supercommentary
to the mystical Bible commentary by the Italian
Menahem Recanati.</p>

<p>Beginning with the seventeenth century, the old Theoretic
Cabala is gradually superseded in Poland by the Practical
Cabala,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> taught by the new school of ARI<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and Vital.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The
Cabalist Isaiah Horowitz, author of the famous work on
ascetic morals called SHeLoH,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> had been trained in the yeshibahs
of Cracow and Lemberg, and for several years (1600-1606)
occupied the post of rabbi in Volhynia. His son, Sheftel
Horowitz, who was rabbi in Posen (1641-1658), published the
mystical work of his father, adding from his own pen a moralist
treatise under the title <i>Vave ha-`Amudim</i>.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Nathan Spira,
preacher and rector of the Talmudic academy in Cracow (1585-1633),
made a specialty of the Practical Cabala. His more
ingenious than thoughtful book, "Discovering Deep Things"<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
(<i>Megalle `Amukoth</i>, Cracow, 1637), contains an exposition in
two hundred and fifty-two different ways of Moses' plea before
God for permission to enter the Promised Land (Deuteronomy
iii. 23). It consists of an endless chain of Cabalistic word-combinations
and obscure symbolic allusions, yielding some
inconceivable deductions, such as that Moses prayed to God
concerning the appearance of the two Messiahs of the house
of Joseph and David, or that Moses endeavored to eliminate
the power of evil and to expiate in advance all the sins
that would ever be committed by the Jewish people. Nathan
Spira applied to the Cabala the method of the Rabbinical
pilpul, and created a new variety of dialectic mysticism, which
was just as far removed from sound theology as the scholastic
speculations of the pilpulists were from scientific thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a><br /><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>More wholesome and more closely related to life was the
trend of the Jewish apologetic literature which sprang up in
Poland in the last quarter of the sixteenth century. The
religious unrest which had been engendered by the Reformation
gave rise to several rationalistic sects with radical,
anti-ecclesiastic tendencies. Nearest of all to the tenets of
Judaism was the sect of the Anti-Trinitarians (called Unitarians,
Arians, or Socinians<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>), who denied the dogma of the
Trinity and the divine nature of Jesus, but recognized the
religious and moral teachings of the Gospels. Among the Anti-Trinitarian
leaders were the theologian Simon Budny, of
Vilna, and Martin Chekhovich, of Lublin. Stung by the fact
that the Catholic clergy applied to them the contemptuous appellation
of "Judaizers," or semi-Jews, the sectarians were
anxious to demonstrate to the world that their doctrine had
nothing in common with Judaism. For this purpose they
carried on oral disputes with the rabbis, and tried to expose
the "Jewish falsehoods" in their works.</p>

<p>Martin Chekhovich was particularly zealous in holding theological
disputations, both in Lublin and in other cities, "with
genuine as well as pseudo-Jews." The results of these disputations
are embodied in several chapters of his books entitled
"Christian Dialogues" (1575) and "Catechism" (1580).
One of his Jewish opponents, Jacob (Nahman) of Belzhytz,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
found it necessary to answer him in public in a little book written
in the Polish language (<i>Odpis na dyalogi Czechowicza</i>,
"Retort to the Dialogues of Chekhovich," 1581). Jacob of
Belzhytz defends the simple dogmas of Judaism, and accuses
his antagonists of desiring to arouse hostility to the Jewish
people. The following observation of Jacob is interesting as
showing the methods of disputation then in vogue:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<p>It often happens that a Christian puts a question to me from
Holy Writ, to which I reply also from Holy Writ, and I try to
argue it properly. But suddenly he will pick out another passage
[from the Bible], saying: "How do you understand this?" and
thus he does not finish the first question, on which it would be
necessary to dwell longer. This is exactly what happens when
the hunter's dogs are hounding the rabbit which flees from the
road into a by-path, and, while the dogs are trying to catch it,
slips away into the bushes. For this reason the Jew too has to
interrupt the Christian in the midst of his speech, lest the latter
escape like the rabbit as soon as he has finished speaking.</p></div>

<p>Chekhovich replied to Jacob's pamphlet in print in the same
year. While defending his "Dialogues," he criticized the
errors of the Talmud, and made sport of several Jewish
customs, such as the use of <i>tefillin</i>, <i>mezuza</i>, and <i>tzitzith</i>.</p>

<p>A serious retort to the Christian theologians came from Isaac
Troki, a cultured Karaite,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> who died in 1594. He argued
with Catholics, Lutherans, and Arians in Poland, not as a
dilettante, but as a profound student of the Gospels and of
Christian theology. About 1593 he wrote his remarkable
apologetic treatise under the title <i>Hizzuk Emuna</i> ("Fortification
of the Faith"). In the first part of his book, the author
defends Judaism against the attacks of the Christian theologians,
while in the second he takes the offensive and criticizes
the teachings of the Church. He detects a whole series of contradictions
in the texts of the Synoptic Gospels, pointing out
the radical deviations of the New Testament from the Old and
the departure of the later dogmatism of the Church from the
New Testament itself. With calmness and assurance he proves
the logical and historical impossibility of the interpretations of
the well-known Biblical prophecies which serve as the substructure
of the Christian dogma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>For a long time no one was bold enough to print this "dreadful
treatise," and it was circulated in manuscript both in the
Hebrew original and in a Spanish and German version. The
Hebrew original, accompanied by a Latin translation, was
printed for the first time from a defective copy by the German
scholar Wagenseil, Professor of Law in Bavaria. Wagenseil
published the treatise <i>Hizzuk Emuna</i> in his collection of anti-Christian
writings, to which he gave the awe-inspiring title
"The Fiery Arrows of Satan" (<i>Tela Ignea Satanae</i>, 1681),
and which were published for missionary purposes, "in order
that the Christians may refute this book, which may otherwise
fortify the Jews in their errors." The pious German professor
could not foresee that his edition would he subsequently employed
by men of the type of Voltaire and the French encyclopedists
of the eighteenth century as a weapon to attack
the doctrine of the Church. Voltaire commented on the book
of Isaac Troki in these words: "Not even the most decided
opponents of religion have brought forward any arguments
which could not be found in the 'Fortification of the Faith'
by Rabbi Isaac." In modern times the <i>Hizzuk Emuna</i> has
been reprinted from more accurate copies, and has been translated
into several European languages.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
THE AUTONOMOUS CENTER IN POLAND DURING
ITS DECLINE (1648-1772)</h2>


<p>1. <span class="smcap">Economic and National Antagonism in the Ukraina</span></p>

<p>The Jewish center in Poland, marked by compactness of
numbers and a widespread autonomous organization, seemed,
down to the end of the seventeenth century, to be the only
secure nest of the Jewish people and the legitimate seat of its
national hegemony, which was slipping out of the hands
of German Jewry. But in 1648 this comparatively peaceful
nest was visited by a storm, which made the Jews of
Eastern Europe speedily realize that they would have to tread
the same sorrowful path, strewn with the bodies of martyrs, that
had been traversed by their Western European brethren in the
Middle Ages. The factors underlying this crisis were three: an
acute economic class struggle, racial and religious antagonism,
and the appearance upon the horizon of Jewish history of a new
power of darkness&mdash;the semi-barbarous masses of Southern
Russia.</p>

<p>In the central provinces of Poland the position of the Jews,
as was pointed out previously, was determined by the interaction
of class and economic forces on the one hand, and
religious and political interests on the other, changing in accordance
with the different combinations of the opposing factions.
While the kings and the great nobles, prompted by
fiscal and agrarian considerations, in most cases encouraged the
commercial activities of the Jews, the urban estates, the trade
and merchant guilds, from motives of competition, tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hinder them. As for the Catholic clergy, it was on general
principles ever on the alert to oppress the "infidels."</p>

<p>As far as economic rivalry and social oppression are concerned,
the Jews were able to resist them, either by influencing
the Polish governing circles, or by combining their own forces
and uniting them in a firmly-organized scheme of self-government,
which had been conceded to them in so large a measure.
At any rate, it was a cultural struggle between two elements:
the Polish and the Jewish population, the Christian and the
Jewish estates, or the Church and the Synagogue. This struggle
was vastly complicated in the southeastern border provinces
of Poland, the so-called Ukraina,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> by the presence of a
third element, which was foreign to the Poles no less than to
the Jews&mdash;the local native population which was Russian by
race and Greek Orthodox in religion, and was engaged principally
in agriculture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>The vast region around the southern basin of the Dnieper,
the whole territory comprising the provinces of Kiev, Poltava,
and Chernigov, and including parts of Podolia and Volhynia,
was subject to the political power of the Polish kings and the
economic dominion of the Polish magnates. Enormous estates,
comprising a large number of villages populated by Russian
peasants, were here in the hands of wealthy Polish landlords,
who enjoyed all the rights of feudal owners. The
enthralled peasants, or khlops, as they were contemptuously
nicknamed by the Polish nobles, were strange to their masters
in point of religion and nationality. In the eyes of the Catholics,
particularly in those of the clergy, the Greek Orthodox
faith was a "religion of khlops," and they endeavored to eradicate
it by forcing upon it compulsory church unions<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> or by
persecuting the "dissidents." The Poles looked upon the
Russian populace as an inferior race, which belonged more to
Asia than to Europe. In these circumstances, the economic
struggle between the feudal landlord and his serfs, unmitigated
by the feeling of common nationality and religion, was
bound to assume acute forms. Apart from the oppressive agricultural
labor, which the peasants had to give regularly and
gratuitously to the landlord, they were burdened with a multitude
of minor imposts and taxes, levied on pastures, mills,
hives, etc. The Polish magnates lived, as a rule, far away from
their Ukrainian possessions, leaving the management of the
latter in the hands of stewards and arendars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>Among these rural arendars there were many Jews, who
principally leased from the pans the right of "propination,"
or the sale of spirituous liquors. These leases had the effect of
transferring to the Jews some of the powers over the Russian
serfs which were wielded by the noble landowners. The
Jewish arendar endeavored to derive as much profit from the
nobleman's estate as the owner himself would have derived
had he lived there. But under the prevailing conditions of serfdom
these profits could be extracted only by a relentless
exploitation of the peasants. Moreover, the contemptuous attitude
of the Shlakhta and the Catholic clergy towards the
"religion of khlops," and their endeavors to force the Greek
Orthodox serfs into Catholicism, by imposing upon them an
ecclesiastic union, gave a sharp religious coloring to this
economic antagonism. The oppressed peasantry reacted to
this treatment with ominous murmurings and agrarian disturbances
in several places. The enslaved South Russian
<i>muzhik</i> hated the Polish pan in his capacity as landlord, Catholic,
and <i>Lakh</i>.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> No less intensely did he hate the Jewish arendar,
with whom he came in daily contact, and whom he regarded
both as a steward of the pan and an "infidel," entirely
foreign to him on account of his religious customs and habits
of life. Thus the Ukrainian Jew found himself between
hammer and anvil: between the pan and the khlop, between the
Catholic and the Greek Orthodox, between the Pole and the
Russian. Three classes, three religions, and three nationalities,
clashed on a soil which contained in its bowels terrible volcanic
forces&mdash;and a catastrophe was bound to follow.</p>

<p>The South Russian population, though politically and agriculturally
dependent upon the Poles, was far from being that
patient "beast of burden" into which the rule of serfdom
tried to transform it. Many circumstances combined to foster
a warlike spirit in this population. The proximity of the
New Russian steppes and the Khanate of the Crimea, whence
hordes of Tatars often burst forth to swoop down like birds of
prey upon the eastern provinces of Poland, compelled the inhabitants
of the Ukraina to organize themselves into warlike companies,
or Cossacks,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> to fight off the invaders. The Polish Government,
acting through its local governors or starostas, encouraged the formation of these companies for the defense of
the borders of the Empire. In this way Ukrainian Cossackdom,
a semi-military, semi-agricultural caste, came into being,
with an autonomous organization and its own <i>hetman</i><a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> at
the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from the Ukrainian Cossacks, who were subject to the
Polish Government, there were also the so-called Zaporozhian<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Cossacks, a completely independent military organization
which lived beyond the Falls of the Dnieper, in the steppes of
so-called New Russia, the present Governments of Yekaterinoslav
and Kherson, and indulged in frequent raids upon
the Turks and in constant warfare with the Tatars of the
Crimea. This military camp, or <i>syech</i>,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> beyond the Falls of the
Dnieper attracted many khlops from the Ukraina, who preferred
a free, unrestricted military life to the dreary existence
of laboring slaves. The syech represented a primitive military
republic, where daring, pluck, and knightly exploits were
valued above all. It was a semi-barbarous Tatar horde, except
that it professed the Greek Orthodox faith, and was of Russian
origin, though, by the way, with a considerable admixture
of Mongolian blood. The Ukrainian and Zaporozhian Cossacks
were in constant relations with each other. The peasants
of the Ukraina looked up with pride and hope to this their
national guard, which sooner or later was bound to free them
from the rule of the Poles and Jews. The Polish Government
failed to perceive that on the eastern borders of the Empire
a mass of explosives was constantly accumulating, which
threatened to wreck the whole Polish Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor could the Jews foresee that this terrible force would be
directed against them, and would stain with blood many
pages of their history, serving as a terrible omen for the
future. The first warning was sounded in 1637, when the
Cossack leader Pavluk suddenly appeared from beyond the
Falls in the province of Poltava, inciting the peasants to rise
against the pans and the Jews. The rebels demolished several
synagogues in the town of Lubny and in neighboring places,
and killed about two hundred Jews. The real catastrophe,
however, came ten years later. The mutiny of the Cossacks
and the Ukrainian peasants in 1648 inaugurates in the history
of the Jews of Eastern Europe the era of pogroms, which
Southern Russia bequeathed to future generations down to the
beginning of the twentieth century.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Pogroms and Massacres of 1648-1649</span></p>

<p>In the spring of 1648, while King Vladislav IV. still sat on
the throne of Poland, one of the popular Cossack leaders, Bogdan
Khmelnitzki, from the town of Chigirin, in the province
of Kiev, unfurled the banner of rebellion in the Ukraina and
in the region beyond the Dnieper Falls. Infuriated by the
conduct of the Polish authorities of his native place,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Khmelnitzki
began to incite the Ukrainian Cossacks to armed resistance.
They elected him secretly their hetman, and empowered
him to conduct negotiations with the Zaporozhians. Having
arrived in the region beyond the Dnieper Falls, he organized
military companies, and concluded an alliance with the Khan
of the Crimea, who entered into a compact to send large troops
of Tatars to the aid of the rebels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>In April, 1648, the combined hosts of the Cossacks and Tatars
moved from beyond the Falls of the Dnieper to the borders
of the Ukraina. In the neighborhood of the Yellow Waters and
Korsun they inflicted a severe defeat on the Polish army under
the command of Pototzki and Kalinovski (May 6-15), and this
defeat served as a signal for the whole region on the eastern
banks of the Dnieper to rise in rebellion. The Russian peasants
and town dwellers left their homes, and, organizing themselves
into bands, devastated the estates of the pans, slaying
their owners as well as the stewards and Jewish arendars. In
the towns of Pereyaslav, Piryatin, Lokhvitz, Lubny, and the
surrounding country, thousands of Jews were barbarously
killed, and their property was either destroyed or pillaged.
The rebels allowed only those to survive who embraced the
Greek Orthodox faith. The Jews of several cities of the Kiev
region, in order to escape from the hands of the Cossacks, fled
into the camp of the Tatars, and gave themselves up voluntarily
as prisoners of war. They knew that the Tatars refrained
as a rule from killing them, and transported them
instead into Turkey, where they were sold as slaves, and had a
chance of being ransomed by their Turkish coreligionists.</p>

<p>At that juncture, in the month of May, King Vladislav IV.
died, and an interregnum ensued, which, marked by political
unrest, lasted six months. The flame of rebellion seized
the whole of the Ukraina, as well as Volhynia and Podolia.
Bands composed of Cossacks and Russian peasants led by
Khmelnitzki's accomplices, savage Zaporozhian Cossacks, dispersed
in all directions, and began to exterminate Poles and
Jews. To quote a Russian historian:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Killing was accompanied by barbarous tortures; the victims
were flayed alive, split asunder, clubbed to death, roasted on coals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>or scalded with boiling water. Even infants at the breast were not
spared. The most terrible cruelty, however, was shown towards
the Jews. They were destined to utter annihilation, and the
slightest pity shown to them was looked upon as treason. Scrolls of
the Law were taken out of the synagogues by the Cossacks, who
danced on them while drinking whiskey. After this Jews were
laid down upon them, and butchered without mercy. Thousands
of Jewish infants were thrown into wells, or buried alive.</p></div>

<p>Contemporary Jewish chroniclers add that these human
beasts purposely refrained from finishing their victims, so as to
be able to torture them longer. They cut off their hands and
feet, split the children asunder, "fish-like," or roasted them on
fire. They opened the bowels of women, inserted live cats, and
then sewed up the wounds. The unbridled bestiality of intoxicated
savages found expression in these frightful tortures,
of which even the Tatars were incapable.</p>

<p>Particularly tragic was the fate of those Jews who, in the
hope of greater safety, had fled from the villages and townlets
to the fortified cities. Having learned that several thousand
Jews had taken refuge in the town of Niemirov in Podolia,
Khmelnitzki dispatched thither a detachment of Cossacks
under the command of the Zaporozhian Gania. Finding it
difficult to take the city by storm, the Cossacks resorted to a
trick. They drew nigh to Niemirov, carrying aloft the Polish
banners and requesting admission into the city. The Jews,
fooled into believing that it was a Polish army that had come
to their rescue, opened the gates (Sivan 20 = June 10, 1648).
The Cossacks, in conjunction with the local Russian inhabitants,
fell upon the Jews and massacred them; the women and
girls were violated. The Rabbi and Rosh-Yeshibah of Niemirov,
Jehiel Michael ben Eliezer, hid himself in the cemetery
with his mother, hoping in this wise at least to be buried after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
death. There he was seized by one of the rioters, a shoemaker,
who began to club him. His aged mother begged the murderer
to kill her instead of her son, but the inhuman shoemaker
killed first the rabbi and then the aged woman.</p>

<p>The young Jewish women were frequently allowed to live,
the Cossacks and peasants forcing them into baptism and taking
them for wives. One beautiful Jewish girl who had been
kidnaped for this purpose by a Cossack managed to convince
him that she was able to throw a spell over bullets. She asked
him to shoot at her, so as to prove to him that the bullet would
glide off without causing her any injury. The Cossack discharged
his gun, and the girl fell down, mortally wounded, yet
happy in the knowledge that she was saved from a worse fate.
Another Jewish girl, whom a Cossack was on the point of
marrying, threw herself from the bridge into the water,
while the wedding procession was marching to the church.
Altogether about six thousand Jews perished in the city of
Niemirov.</p>

<p>Those who escaped death fled to the fortified Podolian
town of Tulchyn. Here an even more terrible tragedy was
enacted. A large horde of Cossacks and peasants laid siege
to the fortress, which contained several hundred Poles and
some fifteen hundred Jews. The Poles and Jews took an oath
not to betray one another and to defend the city to their last
breath. The Jews, stationed on the walls of the fortress, shot
at the besiegers, keeping them off from the city. After a long
and unsuccessful siege the Cossacks conceived a treacherous
plan. They informed the Poles of Tulchyn that they were aiming
solely at the Jews, and, as soon as the latter were delivered
into their hands, they would leave the Poles in peace. The
Polish pans, headed by Count Chetvertinski, forgot their oath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and decided to sacrifice their Jewish allies to secure their own
safety. When the Jews discovered this treacherous intention,
they immediately resolved to dispose of the Poles, whom they
excelled in numbers. But the Rosh-Yeshibah of Tulchyn,
Rabbi Aaron, implored them not to touch the pans, on the
ground that such action might draw upon the Jews all over the
Empire the hatred of the Polish population. "Let us rather
perish," he exclaimed, "as did our brethren in Niemirov, and
let us not endanger the lives of our brethren in all the places of
their dispersion." The Jews yielded. They turned over all
their property to Chetvertinski, asking him to offer it to the
Cossacks as a ransom for their lives.</p>

<p>After entering the city, the Cossacks first took possession of
the property of the Jews, and then drove them together into a
garden, where they put up a banner and declared, "Let those
who are willing to accept baptism station themselves under this
banner, and we will spare their lives." The rabbis exhorted
the people to accept martyrdom for the sake of their religion
and their people. Not a single Jew was willing to become a
traitor, and fifteen hundred victims were murdered in a most
barbarous fashion. Nor did the perfidious Poles escape their
fate. Another detachment of Cossacks, which entered Tulchyn
later, slew all the Catholics, among them Count Chetvertinski.
Treachery avenged treachery.</p>

<p>From Podolia the rebel bands penetrated into Volhynia.
Here the massacres continued in the course of the whole summer
and autumn of 1648. In the town of Polonnoye ten
thousand Jews met their death at the hands of the Cossacks,
or were taken captive by the Tatars. Among the victims
was the Cabalist Samson of Ostropol, who was greatly revered
by the people. This Cabalist, and three hundred pious fellow-Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
who followed him, put on their funeral garments, the
shrouds and prayer shawls, and offered up fervent prayers in
the synagogue, awaiting death in the sacred place, where the
murderers subsequently killed them one by one. Similar massacres
took place in Zaslav, Ostrog, Constantinov, Narol, Kremenetz,
Bar, and many other cities. The Ukraina as well as Volhynia
and Podolia were turned into one big slaughter-house.</p>

<p>The Polish troops, particularly those under the brave command
of Count Jeremiah Vishniovetzki, succeeded in subduing
the Cossacks and peasants in several places, annihilating some
of their bands with the same cruelty that the Cossacks had displayed
towards the Poles and the Jews. The Jews fled to these
troops for their safety, and they were welcomed by Vishniovetzki,
who admitted the unfortunates into the baggage train,
and, to use the expression of a Jewish chronicler, took care of
them "as a father of his children." After the catastrophe of
Niemirov he entered the city with his army, and executed the
local rioters who had participated in the murder of the Jewish
inhabitants. However, standing all alone, he was unable to
extinguish the flame of the Cossack rebellion. For the commanders-in-chief
of the Polish army did not display the proper
energy at this critical moment, and Khmelnitzki was right in
dubbing them contemptuously "featherbeds," "youngsters,"
and "Latins" ("bookworms").</p>

<p>From the Ukraina bands of rebellious peasants, or <i>haidamacks</i>,
penetrated into the nearest towns of White Russia
and Lithuania. From Chernigov and Starodub, where the
Jewish inhabitants had been exterminated, the murderers
moved towards the city of Homel (July or August). A contemporary
gives the following description of the Homel massacre:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The rebels managed to bribe the head of the city, who delivered
the Jews into their hands. The Greeks [<i>Yevanim, i. e.</i> the Greek
Orthodox Russians] surrounded them with drawn swords, and with
daggers and spears, exclaiming: "Why do you believe in your
God, who has no pity on His suffering people, and does not save
it from our hands? Reject your God, and you shall be masters!
But if you will cling to the faith of your fathers, you shall all
perish in the same way as your brethren in the Ukraina, in
Pokutye,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and Lithuania perished at our hands." Thereupon Rabbi
Eliezer, our teacher, the president of the [rabbinical] court, exclaimed:
"Brethren, remember the death of our fellow-Jews, who
perished to sanctify the name of our God! Let us too stretch
forth our necks to the sword of the enemy; look at me and act
as I do!" Immediately thousands of Jews renounced their lives,
despised this world, and hallowed the name of God. The Rosh-Yeshibah
was the first to offer up his body as a burnt-offering.
Young and old, boys and girls saw the tortures, sufferings, and
wounds of the teacher, who did not cease exhorting them to
accept martyrdom in the name of Him who had called into being
the generations of mortals. As one man they all exclaimed:
"Let us forgive one another our mutual insults. Let us offer
up our souls to God and our bodies to the wild waves, to our
enemies, the offspring of the Greeks!" When our enemies heard
these words, they started a terrible butchery, killing their victims
with spears in order that they might die slowly. Husbands, wives,
and children fell in heaps. They did not even attain to burial,
dogs and swine feeding on their dead bodies.</p></div>

<p>In September, 1648, Khmelnitzki himself, marching at the
head of a Cossack army, and accompanied by his Tatar allies,
approached the walls of Lemberg, and began to besiege the capital
of Red Russia, or Galicia. The Cossacks succeeded in
storming and pillaging the suburbs, but they failed to penetrate
to the fortified center of the town. Khmelnitzki proposed
to the magistracy of Lemberg, that it deliver all the
Jews and their property into the hands of the Cossacks, promising
in this case to raise the siege. The magistracy replied
that the Jews were under the jurisdiction of the king, and
the town authorities had no right to dispose of them. Khmelnitzki
thereupon agreed to withdraw, having obtained from the
city an enormous ransom, the bulk of which had been contributed
by the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>From Lemberg Khmelnitzki proceeded with his troops in the
direction of Warsaw, where at that time the election of a new
king was taking place. The choice fell upon John Casimir,
a brother of Vladislav IV., who had been Primate of
Gnesen and a Cardinal (1648-1668). The new King entered
into peace negotiations with the leader of the rebels, the hetman
Khmelnitzki. But owing to the excessive demands of the Cossacks
the negotiations were broken off, and as a result, in the
spring of 1649, the flame of civil war flared up anew, accompanied
by the destruction of many more Jewish communities.
After a succession of battles in which the Poles were defeated,
a treaty of peace was concluded between John Casimir and
Khmelnitzki, in the town of Zborov. In this treaty, which was
favorable to the Cossacks, a clause was included forbidding the
residence of Jews in the portion of the Ukraina inhabited by the
Cossacks, the regions of Chernigov, Poltava, Kiev, and partly
Podolia (August, 1649).</p>

<p>At last the Jews, after a year and a half of suffering and
tortures, could heave a sigh of relief. Those of them who,
at the point of death, had embraced the Greek Orthodox
faith, were permitted by King John Casimir to return to their
old creed. The Jewish women who had been forcibly baptized
fled in large numbers from their Cossack husbands, and returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to their families. The Council of the Four Lands,
which met in Lublin in the winter of 1650, framed a set of
regulations looking to the restoration of normal conditions
in the domestic and communal life of the Jews. The day of
the Niemirov massacre (Sivan 20), which coincided with an
old fast day in memory of the martyrs of the Crusades, was
appointed a day of mourning, to commemorate the victims
of the Cossack rebellion. Leading rabbis of the time composed
a number of soul-stirring dirges and prayers, which were
recited in the synagogues on the fateful anniversary of the
twentieth of Sivan.</p>

<p>But the respite granted to the Jews after these terrible events
did not last long. The Treaty of Zborov, which was unsatisfactory
to the Polish Government, was not adhered to by it. Mutual
resentment gave rise to new collisions, and civil war broke out
again, in 1651. The Polish Government called together the
national militia, which included a Jewish detachment of one
thousand men. This time the people's army got the upper
hand against the troops of Khmelnitzki, with the result that a
treaty of peace was concluded which was advantageous to the
Poles. In the Treaty of Byelaya Tzerkov, concluded in September,
1651, many claims of the Cossacks were rejected, and
the right of the Jews to live in the Greek Orthodox portion
of the Ukraina was restored.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>As a result, the Cossacks and Greek Orthodox Ukrainians
rose again. Bogdan Khmelnitzki entered into negotiations
with the Russian Tzar Alexis Michaelovich, looking to the
incorporation, with the rights of an autonomous province, of
the Greek Orthodox portion of the Ukraina, under the name of
Little Russia, into the Muscovite Empire. In 1654 this incorporation
took place, and in the same year the Russian army
marched upon White Russia and Lithuania to wage war on
Poland. Now came the turn of the Jews of the northwestern
region to endure their share of suffering.</p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap">The Russian and Swedish Invasions (1654-1658)</span></p>

<p>The alliance of their enemies, the Cossacks, with the rulers of
Muscovy, a country which had always felt a superstitious dread
of the people of other lands and religions, was fraught with
untold misery for the Jews. It was now the turn of the inhabitants
of White Russia and Lithuania to face the hordes of
southern and northern Scythians, who invaded the regions
hitherto spared by them, devastating them uninterruptedly for
two years (1654-1656). The capture of the principal Polish
cities by the combined hosts of the Muscovites and Cossacks
was accompanied by the extermination or expulsion of the
Jews. When Moghilev on the Dnieper<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> surrendered to Russian
arms, Tzar Alexis Michaelovich complied with the request
of the local Russian inhabitants, and gave orders to expel the
Jews and divide their houses between the magistracy and the
Russian authorities (1654). The Jews, however, who were
hoping for a speedy termination of hostilities, failed to leave
the city at once, and had to pay severely for it. Towards the
end of the summer of 1655 the commander of the Russian garrison
in Moghilev, Colonel Poklonski, learned of the approach
of a Polish army under the command of Radziwill. Prompted
by the fear that the Jewish residents might join the approaching
enemy, Poklonski ordered the Jews to leave the boundaries
of the city, and, on the ground of their being Polish subjects,
promised to have them transferred to the camp of Radziwill.
Scarcely had the Jews, accompanied by their wives and
children, and carrying with them their property, left the town
behind them when the Russian soldiers, at the command of the
same Poklonski, fell upon them and killed nearly all of them,
plundering their property at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>In Vitebsk the Jews took an active part in defending the
town against the besieging Russian army. They dug trenches
around the fortified castle, strengthened the walls, supplied the
soldiers with arms, powder, and horses, and acted as scouts.
When the city was finally taken by the Russians, the Jews were
completely robbed by the Zaporozhian Cossacks, while many
of them were taken captive, forcibly baptized, or exiled to
Pskov, Novgorod, and Kazan.</p>

<p>The Jews suffered no less heavily from the riot which
took place in Vilna, the capital of Lithuania, after its occupation
by the combined army of Muscovites and Cossacks in
August, 1655. A large part of the Vilna community fled for its
life. Those who remained behind were either killed or banished
from the town at the command of Tzar Alexis Michaelovich,
who was anxious to comply with the request of the local Russian
townspeople, to rid them of their Jewish competitors.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter a similar fate overtook the central Polish
provinces on the Vistula and the San River, which had hitherto
been spared the horrors of the Cossacks and Muscovites. The
invasion of Sweden, the third enemy of Poland (1655-1658),
carried bloodshed into the very heart of the country. The
Swedish King, Charles Gustav, reduced one city after the other,
both the old and the new capital, Cracow and Warsaw, speedily
surrendering to him. A large part of Great and Little Poland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
fell into the hands of the Swedes, and the Polish King, John
Casimir, was compelled to flee to Silesia.</p>

<p>The easy victories of the Swedes were the result of the
anarchy and political demoralization which had taken deep root
in Poland. It was the treachery of the former Polish sub-Chancellor
Radzieyevski that brought the Swedes into Poland,
and the cowardice of the Shlakhta hastily surrendered the cities
of Posen, Kalish, Cracow, and Vilna, to the enemy. Moreover
the Swedes were welcomed by the Polish Protestants and Calvinists,
who looked for their rescue to the northern Protestant
power in the same way in which the Cossacks expected their
salvation from Orthodox Russia.</p>

<p>The Jews were the only ones who had no political advantage
in betraying their country, and their friendly attitude towards
the Swedes no more than corresponded to the conduct of the
Swedes towards them. At any rate, their patriotism was no
more open to suspicion than that of the Poles themselves, who
joined the power of Sweden to get rid of the yoke of Muscovy.
Nevertheless, the Jews had to pay a terrible price for this lack
of patriotism. They found themselves, in the words of a
contemporary chronicler, in the position of a man who "fleeth
from a lion, and is met by a bear."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The Jews who had been
spared by the Swedes were now annihilated by the patriotic
Poles, who charged them with disloyalty. The bands of Polish
irregulars, which had been organized in 1656, under the command
of General Charnetzki, to save the country from the
invader, vented their fury upon the Jews in all the localities
which they wrested from the Swedes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>The massacre of Jews began in Great and Little Poland,
without yielding in point of barbarism to the butcheries which,
eight years previously, had been perpetrated in the Ukraina.
The Polish hosts of Charnetzki had learned from the Cossacks
the art of exterminating the Jews. Nearly all the Jewish
communities in the province of Posen, excepting the city of
Posen, and those in the provinces of Kalish, Cracow, and
Piotrkov, were destroyed by the saviors of the Polish fatherland.
The brutal and wicked Charnetzki, to use the epithets
applied to him by the Jewish annalists, or, to be more exact,
the Polish mob marching behind him, committed atrocities
which were truly worthy of the Cossacks. They tortured
and murdered the rabbis, violated the women, killed the Jews
by the hundreds, sparing only those who were willing to become
Catholics. These atrocities were as a rule committed in the
wake of the retreating Swedes, who had behaved like human
beings towards the Jewish population. The humaneness shown
by the Swedes to the Jews was avenged by the inhumanity of
the Poles.</p>

<p>While the bands of Charnetzki were attacking the Jews in
Western Poland, the Muscovites and Cossacks continued to
disport themselves in the eastern districts and in Lithuania.
Not until 1658 did the horrors of warfare begin gradually to
subside, and only after terrible losses and humiliating concessions
to Russia and Sweden was Poland able to restore its
political order, which had been shaken to its foundation during
the preceding years.</p>

<p>The losses inflicted upon the Jews of Poland during the
fatal decade of 1648-1658 were appalling. In the reports of
the chroniclers the number of Jewish victims varies between
one hundred thousand and five hundred thousand. But even
if we accept the lower figure, the number of victims still remains
colossal, excelling the catastrophes of the Crusades and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the Black Death in Western Europe. Some seven hundred
Jewish communities in Poland had suffered massacre and
pillage. In the Ukrainian cities situated on the left banks of
the Dnieper, the region populated by Cossacks, in the present
Governments of Chernigov, Poltava, and part of Kiev, the
Jewish communities had disappeared almost completely. In
the localities on the right shore of the Dnieper or in the Polish
part of the Ukraina as well as in those of Volhynia and
Podolia, wherever the Cossacks had made their appearance,
only about one-tenth of the Jewish population survived. The
others had either perished during the rebellion of Khmelnitzki,
or had been carried off by the Tatars into Turkey, or had emigrated
to Lithuania, the central provinces of Poland, or the
countries of Western Europe. All over Europe and Asia
Jewish refugees or prisoners of war could be met with, who
had fled from Poland, or had been carried off by the Tatars,
and ransomed by their brethren. Everywhere the wanderers
told a terrible tale of the woes of their compatriots and of the
martyrdom of hundreds of Jewish communities.</p>

<p>An echo of all these horrors resounds in contemporary chronicles
and mournful synagogue liturgies. One of the eye-witnesses
of the Ukraina massacres, Nathan Hannover, from
Zaslav, gives a striking description of it in his historical chronicle
<i>Yeven Metzula</i><a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> (1653). Sabbatai Kohen, the famous
scholar of Vilna,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> brought this catastrophe to the notice of the
Jewish world through a circular letter, entitled <i>Meghillath
Efa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> which was accompanied by prayers in memory of the
Polish martyrs. In heartrending liturgies many contemporary
rabbis and writers, such as Lipman Heller, Rabbi of Cracow,
Sheftel Horovitz, Rabbi of Posen, the scholars Meïr of Shchebreshin<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
(<i>Tzok ha-`Ittim</i>,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> 1650) and Gabriel Shussberg
(<i>Petah Teshuba</i>,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> 1653), lament the destruction of Polish
Jewry. All these writings are pervaded with the bitter consciousness
that Polish Jewry would never recuperate from the
blows it had received, and that the peaceful nest in which the
persecuted nation had found a refuge was destroyed forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>4. <span class="smcap">The Restoration (1658-1697)</span></p>

<p>Fortunately these apprehensions proved to be exaggerated.
Though decimated and impoverished, the Jewish population of
Poland exceeded in numbers the Jewish settlements of Western
Europe. The chief center of Judaism remained in Poland as
theretofore, though it became the center of a more circumscribed
and secluded section of Jewry. The extraordinary
vitality of the "eternal people" was again demonstrated by the
fact that the Polish Jews were able, in a comparatively short
time, to recover from their terrible losses. No sooner had peace
been restored in Poland than they began to return to their demolished
nests and to re-establish their economic position and
communal self-government, which had been so violently
shaken. King John Casimir, having resumed the reins of
government, declared that it was his inmost desire to compensate
his Jewish subjects, though it be only in part, for the
sufferings inflicted upon them and to assist them in recuperating
from material ruin. This declaration the King made in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
form of a charter bestowing the right of free commerce upon
the Jews of Cracow (1661). Various privileges, as well as
temporary alleviations in the payment of taxes, were conferred
by him upon numerous other Jewish communities which had
suffered most from the horrors of the Cossacks and the invasions
of the Russians and Swedes.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that all this could only soften the
consequences of the terrible economic crisis, but could not
avert them. The crisis left its sad impress particularly upon
the South, which had been the scene of the Cossack rebellion.
As far as the Ukraina was concerned, peace was not completely
restored for a long time. By the Treaty of Andrusovo, of 1667,
Poland and Muscovy divided the province between them: the
portion situated on the right bank of the Dnieper (Volhynia
and Podolia) remained with Poland, while the section on the
left bank of the same river, called Little Russia (the region
of Poltava, Chernigov, and part of the district of Kiev, including
the city of the same name), was ceded to Muscovy. However,
in consequence of the party dissensions which divided the
ranks of the Cossacks, and made their various hetmans gravitate
now towards the one, now towards the other, of the sovereign
powers, the Ukraina continued for a long time to be
an apple of discord between Poland, Russia, and Turkey. This
agitation handicapped alike the agricultural pursuits of the
peasants and the commercial activities of the Jews. In Little
Russia the Jews had almost disappeared, while in the Polish
Ukraina they had become greatly impoverished. The southwestern
region, where the Jews had once upon a time lived so
comfortably, sank economically lower and lower, and gradually
yielded its supremacy to the northwest, to Lithuania and
White Russia, which had suffered comparatively little during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the years of unrest. The transfer of the cultural center of
Judaism from the south to the north forms one of the characteristic
features of the period.</p>

<p>Michael Vishniovetzki (1669-1673), who was elected King
after John Casimir, extended his protection to the Jews by
virtue of family traditions, being a son of the hero Jeremiah
Vishniovetzki, who had saved many a Jewish community of the
Ukraina during the sinister years of the Cossack mutiny. At
the Coronation Diet<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Vishniovetzki ratified the fundamental
privileges of the Polish and Lithuanian Jews, "as far as these
privileges are not in contradiction with the general laws and
customs." This ratification had been obtained through an
application of the "general syndic of the Jews," Moses Markovich,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
who evidently acted as the spokesman of all the Kahals
of the ancient provinces of Poland. The benevolent intentions
of the King were counteracted by the Diets, which, controlled
by the clergy and Shlakhta, issued restrictive laws against the
Jews. The Diet of Warsaw held in 1670 not only limited the
financial operations of Jewish capitalists by fixing a maximum
rate of interest (20%)<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>&mdash;this would have been perfectly legitimate&mdash;but
also thought it necessary to restore the old canonical
regulations forbidding the Jews to keep Christian domestics
or to leave their houses during the Church processions. In
these Diet regulations, particularly in their tone and motivation
("in order that the perfidy and self-will of the Jews
should not gain the upper hand," etc.), one cannot fail to
perceive the venom of the Catholic clergy, which once more
engaged in its old <i>métier</i> of slandering the Jews, charging
them with hostility to the Christians and with the desecration
of Church sacraments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The influence of these Church fanatics upon the Polish
schools, coupled with the general deterioration of morals as
a result of the protracted wars, was responsible for the recrudescence,
during that period, of the ugly street attacks upon
the Jews by the students of the Christian colleges, the so-called
<i>Schülergeläuf</i>. These scholastic excesses now became an everyday
occurrence in the cities of Poland. The riotous scholars
not only caused public scandals by insulting Jewish passers-by
on the street, but frequently invaded the Jewish quarters,
where they instituted regular pogroms. Most of these disorders
were engineered by the pupils of the Academy of
Cracow and the Jesuit schools in Posen, Lemberg, Vilna, and
Brest.</p>

<p>The local authorities were passive onlookers of these savage
pranks of the future citizens of Poland, which occasionally
assumed very dangerous forms. In order to protect themselves
from such attacks many Jewish communities paid an annual
tax to the rectors of the local Catholic schools, and this tax,
which was called <i>kozubales</i>, was officially recognized by the
"common law" then in use. However, even the ransom
agreed upon could not save the Jews of Lemberg from a bloody
pogrom. The pupils of the Cathedral school and the Jesuit
Academy of that city were preparing to storm the Jewish
quarter. Having learned of the intentions of the rioters, the
Jewish youth of Lemberg organized an armed self-defense,
and courageously awaited the enemy. But the attack of the
Christian students, who were assisted by the mob, was so furious
that the Jewish guard was unable to hold its own. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
resistance of the Jews only resulted in exasperating the rioters,
and the disorders took the form of a massacre. About a hundred
Jewish dead, a large number of demolished houses, several
desecrated synagogues, were the result of the barbarous amusement
of the disciples of the militant Church (1664).</p>

<p>Of the medieval trials of that period two cases, one in Lithuania
and the other in the Crown, stand out with particular
prominence. The former took place in the little town of
Ruzhany, in the province of Grodno, in 1657. The local
Christians, who on their Easter festival had placed a dead
child's body in the yard of a Jew, thereupon charged the whole
community with having committed a ritual murder. The trial
lasted nearly three years, and ended in the execution of two
representatives of the Jewish community, Rabbi Israel and
Rabbi Tobias. A dirge commemorating this event, composed
by a son of one of the martyrs, contains a heartrending description
of the tragedy.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>My enemies have arisen against me, and have spread their nets
in the shape of a false accusation in order to destroy my possessions.
They took dead bodies, slashed them, and spoke with
furious cunning: Behold, the ill-fated Jews drink and suck the
blood of the murdered, and feed on the children of the Gentiles.
Three years did the horrible slander last, and we thought our
liberation was near, but, alas, terrible darkness has engulfed us.
Our sworn enemies dragged us before their hostile court. The
evil-doers assembled in the week before the New Year, and turned
justice into wormwood. A wily and wicked Gentile judged only
by the sight of his eyes, without witnesses; he judged innocent
and sinless people in order to shed pure blood. The horde of
evil-doers pronounced a perverted verdict, saying: "Choose ye
[for execution] two Jews, such as may please you." A beautiful
pair fell into their nets: Rabbi Israel and Rabbi Tobias, the
holy ones, were singled out from among the community.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> These
men saw the glittering blade of the sword, but no fear fell upon
them. They clasped each other's hands and swore to share the
same fate. "Let us take courage, and let us prepare with a light
heart to sacrifice ourselves. Let us become the lambs for the
slaughter; we shall surely find protection under the wings of
God." On the sixth day these holy men were led out to execution,
and an altar was erected. The wrath of the Lord burst forth
in the year of "Recompense,"<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> on the festival of Commemoration
[New Year]. The bitterness of death was awaiting [the martyrs]
in the midst of the market-place. They confessed their sins, saying:
"We have sinned before the Lord. Let us sanctify His name
like Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah." They turned to the executioner,
saying: "Grant us one hour of respite, that we may
render praise unto the Lord." The lips of the impure, the false
lips of those who pursue the wind and worship corrupt images,
came to tempt them with strange beliefs,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> but the holy men exclaimed:
"Away, ye impure! Shall we renounce the living
God, and wander after trees?"<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The holy Rabbi Israel stretched
forth his neck, and shouted with all his might: "Hear, O Israel,
the Lord our God, the Lord is one." Thereupon the executioner
stretched forth his hand to take the sword, and the costly vessel
was shattered. When the holy Rabbi Tobias saw this loss, he
exclaimed: "Blessed art thou, O Rabbi Israel, who hast passed
first into the Realm of Light. I follow thee." He too exclaimed:
"Hear, O Israel, who art guarded [by God] like the apple of the
eye." And he went forth to die in the name of the Lord, and [the
executioner] slew him as he had slain the first.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Another tragedy took place in Cracow, in 1663. The
educated Jewish apothecary Mattathiah Calahora, a native of
Italy who had settled in Cracow, committed the blunder of
arguing with a local priest, a member of the Dominican order,
about religious topics. The priest invited Calahora to a disputation
in the cloister, but the Jew declined, promising to
expound his views in writing. A few days later the priest found
on his chair in the church a statement written in German
and containing a violent arraignment of the cult of the Immaculate
Virgin. It is not impossible that the statement was
composed and placed in the church by an adherent of the
Reformation or the Arian heresy,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> both of which were then
the object of persecution in Poland. However, the Dominican
decided that Calahora was the author, and brought the charge
of blasphemy against him.</p>

<p>The Court of the Royal Castle cross-examined the defendant
under torture, without being able to obtain a confession. Witnesses
testified that Calahora was not even able to write German.
Being a native of Italy, he used the Italian language in his
conversations with the Dominican. In spite of all this evidence,
the unfortunate Calahora was sentenced to be burned at the
stake. The alarmed Jewish community raised a protest, and
the case was accordingly transferred to the highest court in
Piotrkov.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The accused was sent in chains to Piotrkov, together
with the plaintiff and the witnesses. But the arch-Catholic tribunal
confirmed the verdict of the lower court, ordering that
the sentence be executed in the following barbarous sequence:
first the lips of the "blasphemer" to be cut off; next his hand
that had held the fateful statement to be burned; then the
tongue, which had spoken against the Christian religion, to be
excised; finally the body to be burned at the stake, and the ashes
of the victim to be loaded into a cannon and discharged into the
air. This cannibal ceremonial was faithfully carried out on
December 13, 1663, on the market-place of Piotrkov. For two
centuries the Jews of Cracow followed the custom of reciting,
on the fourteenth of Kislev, in the old synagogue of that city, a
memorial prayer for the soul of the martyr Calahora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>There is evidently some connection between this event and
the epistle sent by the General of the Dominican Order in Rome,
Marini, to the head of the order in Cracow, dated February 9,
1664. Marini states that the "unfortunate Jews" of Poland
had complained to him about the "wicked slanders" and accusations,
the "sole purpose" of which was to influence the
Diet soon to assemble at Warsaw, and demonstrate to it that
"the Polish people hate the Jews unconditionally." He requests
his colleagues in Cracow and the latter's subordinates
"to defend the hapless people against every calumny invented
against them." Subsequent history shows that the epistle was
sent in vain.</p>

<p>The last Polish king who extended efficient protection to the
Jews against the classes and parties hostile to them, was
John III. Sobieski (1674-1696), who by his military exploits
succeeded in restoring the political prestige of Poland. This
King had frequent occasion to fight the growing anti-Semitic
tendencies of the Shlakhta, the municipalities, and the clergy.
He granted safe-conducts to various Jewish communities, protecting
their "liberties and privileges," enlarged their sphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of self-government, and freed them from the jurisdiction of
the local municipal authorities. In 1682 he complied with the
request of the Jews of Vilna, who begged to be released from the
municipal census. The application was prompted by the fact
that a year previously they had been induced by the magistracy
of Vilna, which assured them of complete safety, to go outside
the town where the census of the Jews and the Christian trade-unions
was taken. But no sooner had the Jews left the confines
of the city than the members of the trade-unions and other
Christian inhabitants of Vilna began to shoot at them and rob
them of their clothes and valuables. The Jews would have been
entirely annihilated, had not the pupils of the local Jesuit college
taken pity on them, and rescued them from the fury of the
mob. While the riot was in progress, the magistracy of Vilna
not only failed to defend the Jews, but even looked on at the
proceedings "with great satisfaction."</p>

<p>It is necessary to point out that such manifestation of humaneness
on the part of the Polish college youth was a rare
phenomenon, indeed. As a rule, the students themselves were
the initiators of the "tumults" or disorders in the Jewish
quarter, and the scholastic riots referred to previously did not
cease even under John Sobieski. The pupils of the Catholic
academy in Cracow made an attack upon the Jews because of
their refusal to pay the so-called <i>kozubales</i>, the scholastic tax
which had been agreed upon between the Jews and the Christian
colleges (1681-1682). In 1687 the tumultuous scholars,
this time in Posen, were joined by the street mob, and for three
consecutive days the Jews had to defend themselves against the
rioters with weapons in their hands. The national Polish Diets
condemned these forms of violence, and in their "constitutions"
guaranteed to the Jews inviolability of person and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
property, particularly when they found it necessary to raise the
head-tax or impose special levies upon the Jews.</p>

<p>In reality the only defender of the Jews was the King. At his
court appeared the "general syndics," or spokesmen of the
Jewish communities, and presented various applications, which
John Sobieski was ready to grant as far as lay in his power.
This humane attitude towards the "infidels" was on more than
one occasion held up against him at the sessions of the Senate<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
and the Diets. At the Diet held in Grodno in 1693 the enemies
of the court brought charges against the Jew Bezalel, a favorite
of the King and a royal tax-farmer, accusing him of desecrating
the Christian religion, embezzling state funds, and other
crimes. After passionate debates, John Sobieski insisted that
Bezalel be allowed to clear himself by oath of the charge of
blasphemy, while the other accusations were disposed of by the
chancellor of the exchequer.</p>

<p>During the reign of John Sobieski Polish Jewry fully recuperated
from the terrible ravages of the previous epoch.
Under his successors its position became more and more unfavorable.</p>


<p>5. <span class="smcap">Social and Political Dissolution</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>The process of disintegration which had seized the feudal and
clerical structure of the Polish body politic assumed appalling
proportions under the kings of the Saxon dynasty, Augustus II.
and Augustus III. (1697-1763). The political anarchy, which,
coupled with the failures in the Swedish war at the beginning
of the eighteenth century, surrendered Poland into the
hands of rejuvenated Russia under Peter the Great, was only
the external manifestation of the inner decay of the country,
springing from its social order, which was founded on the
arbitrariness of the higher and the servitude of the lower
estates.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> In a land in which every class had regard only for its
own selfish interests, in which the Diets could be broken up by
the whim of a single deputy (the so-called <i>liberum veto</i>), the
Government did not concern itself with the common weal, but
pursued its narrow bureaucratic interests. In these circumstances
the Jews, being oppressed by all the Polish estates, were
gradually deprived of their principal support, the authority
of the king, which had formerly exercised a moderating influence
upon the antagonism of the classes. True, at the
Coronation Diets of Augustus II. and Augustus III. the old
Jewish privileges were officially ratified, but, in consequence
of the prevailing chaos and disorder, the rights, confirmed in
this manner, remained a scrap of paper. Limited as these
rights were, their execution depended on the constant watchfulness
of the supreme powers of the state and on their readiness
to defend these rights against the encroachments of hostile
elements. As a matter of fact, the heedless "Saxon kings,"
being neglectful of the general interests of the country, had no
special reason to pay attention to the interests of the Jews.
The only concern of the Government was the regular collection
of the head-tax from the Kahals. This question of taxation
was discussed with considerable zeal at the "pacific" Diet of
1717, which had been convened in Warsaw for the purpose of
restoring law and order in the country, sorely shaken by the
protracted war with the Swedish king Charles XII. and the
inner anarchy accompanying it. Despite the fact that the
Jews had been practically ruined during that period of unrest,
the amount of the head-tax was considerably increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>The local representatives of the Government, the voyevodas
and starostas,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> whose function was to defend the Jews, frequently
became the most relentless oppressors of the people
under their charge. These provincial satraps looked upon the
Jewish population merely as the object of unscrupulous extortion.
Whenever in need of money, the starostas resorted to
a simple contrivance to fill their pockets: they demanded a
fixed sum from the local Kahal, and threatened, in case of
refusal, imprisonment and other forms of violence. All they
had to do was to send to jail some member of the Jewish
community, preferably a Kahal elder or an influential representative,
and the Kahal was sure to pay the demanded
sum. Occasionally this well-calculated exploitation was relieved
by the aimless mockery of these despots, who were unable
to restrain their savage instincts. Thus the Starosta of Kaniev,
in the Polish Ukraina, desiring to compensate a neighboring
landowner for the murder of his Jewish arendar, gave orders
to load a number of Jews upon a wagon, who were thereupon
carried to the gates of his injured neighbor and thrown down
there like so many bags of potatoes. The same Starosta allowed
himself the following "entertainment": he would order
Jewish women to climb an apple-tree and call like cuckoos. He
would next bombard them with small shot, and watch the unfortunate
women fall wounded from the tree, whereupon,
laughing merrily, he would throw gold coins among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>The most powerful estate in the country, the liberty-loving,
or, more correctly, license-loving Shlakhta, protected the Jews
only when in need of their services. Claiming for himself, in
his capacity as slaveholder, the toil of his peasants, the pan laid
equal claim to the toil of the Jewish business man and arendar
who turned the rural products of his master and the right of
"propination," or liquor-selling, into sources of income for the
latter. At one time the Polish landowners even made the
attempt to enslave the Jews on their estates by legal proceedings.
At the Diet of 1740 the deputies of the nobility brought
in a resolution, that the Jews living on Shlakhta estates be
recognized as the "hereditary subjects" of the owners of those
estates. This monstrous attempt at transforming the rural
Jews into serfs was rejected solely because the Government
refused to forego the income from Jewish taxation, which
in this case would flow into the pockets of the landowners.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the rural Jew was to all intents and purposes
the serf of his pan. The latter exercised full jurisdiction over
his Jewish arendar and "factor"<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> as well as over the residents
on his estates in general. During the savage inroads, frequent
during this period, of one pan upon the estate of another, the
Jewish arendars were the principal sufferers. The meetings of
the local Diets (or Dietines) and the conferences of the
Shlakhta or the sessions of the court tribunals became fixed
occasions for attacking the local Jews, for invading their synagogues
and houses, and engaging, by way of amusement, in all
kinds of "excesses." The Diet of 1717 held in Warsaw protested
against these wild orgies, and threatened the rioters and
the violators of public safety with severe fines. The "custom"
nevertheless remained in vogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>As far as the cities are concerned, the Jews were engulfed
in endless litigation with the Christian merchant guilds and
trade-unions, which wielded a most powerful weapon in their
hands by controlling the city government or the magistracy.
Competition in business and trade was deliberately disguised
beneath the cloak of religion, for the purpose of inciting the
passions of the mob against the Jews. The Christian merchants
and tradesmen found an enthusiastic ally in the Catholic
clergy. The seed sown by the Jesuits yielded a rich harvest.
Religious intolerance, hypocrisy, and superstition had taken
deep root in the Polish people. Religious persecution, directed
against all "infidels," be they Christian dissidents or Jews
"who stubbornly cling to irreligion," was one of the mainsprings
of the inner politics of Poland during its period of
decay.</p>

<p>The enactments of the Catholic synods are permeated by
malign hatred of the Jews, savoring of the spirit of the Middle
Ages. The Synod of Lovich held in 1720 passed a resolution
"that the Jews should nowhere dare build new synagogues
or repair old ones," so that the Jewish houses of worship might
disappear in the course of time, either from decay or through
fire. The Synod of 1733 held in Plotzk repeats the medieval
maxim, that the only reason for tolerating the Jews in a Christian
country is that they might serve as a "reminder of the
tortures of Christ and, by their enslaved and miserable position,
as an example of the just chastisement inflicted by God upon
the infidels."</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">A Frenzy of Blood Accusations</span></p>

<p>The end of the seventeenth century is marked by the frequency
of religious trials, the Jews being charged with ritual
murder and the desecration of Church sacraments. These
charges were the indigenous product of the superstition and
ignorance of the Catholic masses, but they were also used for
propaganda purposes by the clerical party, which sometimes
even took a direct hand in arranging the setting of the crime,
by throwing dead bodies into the yards of Jews, and other similar
contrivances. Such propaganda often resulted in the adoption
of violent measures by the authorities or the mob against
the alleged culprits, leading to the destruction of synagogues
and cemeteries and sometimes culminating in the expulsion of
the Jews.</p>

<p>The cases of ritual murder were tried by the highest court,
the Tribunal of Lublin, and, owing to the zeal of the astute
champions of the Church, frequently ended in the execution of
entirely innocent persons. The most important trials of this
kind, those of Sandomir (1698-1710), Posen (1736), and
Zaslav (1747), were conducted in inquisitorial fashion.</p>

<p>The Sandomir case was brought about by the action of a
Christian woman who threw the dead body of her illegitimate
child into the yard of a Kahal elder, by the name of Berek,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> thus
giving the clergy a chance to engineer a ritual murder trial.
The case passed through all the courts of law. It was greatly
complicated by the fanatical agitation of the priest Stephen
Zhukhovski, who brought two additional charges of ritual murder
against the Jews of Sandomir, and published, on this occasion,
a book full of hideous calumnies. The case having ended
in the lower courts favorably for the Jews, Zhukhovski succeeded
in bringing about a new trial with the application of
tortures and the whole apparatus of the Inquisition. He
finally reached his goal. The Tribunal of Lublin sentenced the
innocent Jewish elder to death; King Augustus II. ordered,
in 1712, the expulsion of all Jews from Sandomir and the
conversion of the synagogue into a Catholic chapel,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and the
Catholic clergy placed a revolting picture in the local church
representing the scene of the ritual murder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>To justify the miscarriage of justice, Father Zhukhovski and
his accomplices induced a converted Jew, by the name of Serafinovich,
who posed as a former Rabbi of Brest, and had testified
at the Sandomir trial against the Jews, to write a book,
entitled "Exposure of the Jewish Ceremonies before God and
the World" (1716). The book, a mixture of a lunatic's
ravings and an adventurer's unrestrained mendacity, centers
around the argument, that the Jews use Christian blood in
the discharge of a large number of religious and everyday
functions. The Jews are alleged to smear the door of a
Christian with such blood, to predispose the latter in favor of
the Jews. The same blood put in an egg is given to newly-married
couples during the marriage ceremony; it is mixed in
the <i>matza</i> eaten on Passover. It is also used for soaking
an incantation formula written by the rabbi, which is then
placed under the threshold of a house, to secure success
in business for the Jewish inmate. In a word, Christian blood
is used by the Jews for every possible form of magic and witchcraft.
To convict Serafinovich publicly of lying, the Jews challenged
him to attend a disputation in Warsaw in the presence
of bishops and rabbis. The disputation had been arranged to
be held in the house of the widow of a high official, and both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Jewish and Christian participants had arrived, but Serafinovich
failed to appear at the meeting, where his trickery and ignorance
would have been exposed. The refusal of the informer to
attend the disputation was attested in an official affidavit. This
fact did not prevent an anti-Semitic monk of Lemberg, by the
name of Pikolski, from republishing Serafinovich's book twice
(1758 and 1760) and using it as a tool to conduct a most
hideous agitation against the Jews.</p>

<p>In the large Jewish community of Posen, the slanderous
accusations against the Jews were the reflection of the inveterate
hostility of the local Christian population. Towards the
end of the seventeenth century the Carmelite order in Posen
contrived a curious lawsuit against the Jews, alleging that
following upon the desecration of the hosts in 1399<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> the Jews
had, by way of penance for their sacrilege, obligated themselves
to accompany the Christian processions. The Jews denied the
allegation, and the case dragged on for a number of years in
various courts of law, with the result that, in 1724, the Jews had
to pledge themselves to furnish the Carmelites with two pails
of oil annually to supply the lamp burning in front of the
three hosts in the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>But the fanaticism of the Church was on the lookout for new
victims, and it manifested itself in 1736 in another ritual murder
trial, which lasted for four years. Everything was pre-arranged
in accordance with the "rites" of the Church fanatics.
The dead body of a Christian child was found in the
neighborhood of the city. There was also found a Polish beggar-woman,
who, under torture, confessed that she had sold the
child to the elders of the Posen community. Arrests followed.
The first victims were the preacher, or <i>darshan</i>, Arie-Leib
Calahora, a descendant of the martyr Mattathiah Calahora,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
an elder (<i>parnas</i>, or syndic) of the Jewish community, by
the name of Jacob Pinkasevich (son of Phineas), and several
other members of the Kahal administration. Further
wholesale arrests were imminent, but many Jews fled from
Posen, to save themselves from the fury of the inquisitors.</p>

<p>On the eve of his arrest, Calahora chose for the text of his
Sabbath discourse the Biblical verse, "Who can count the dust
of Jacob and the number of the fourth part (or quarter) of
Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous!" (Numbers
xxiii. 10). As if anticipating his end, the preacher explained
the text as follows: "Who can count the dust and ashes of
those that were burned and quartered for the faith of Israel?"
While being led to jail, he addressed the crowd of Jews surrounding
him with the following words: "At the hour of my
death I shall not have around me ten Jews for prayer (<i>minyan</i>).
Therefore recite with me for the last time the prayer <i>Borkhu</i>
('Praise the Lord of Praise!')." The forebodings of the
preacher were justified. Neither he nor the elder survived the
fiendish tortures of the cross-examination. While the preacher
was tortured, his bones being broken and his body roasted on
fire, the elder was compelled to hold a lamp in his hand to give
light to the executioner. Covered with wounds and blood, in
the stage of mortal agony, they were carried to their homes,
where they died in the autumn of 1736.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>The deputies of the Jewish community of Posen appealed
to King Augustus III. against the cruelty and partiality of the
municipal court, and succeeded in having the case transferred
to a special judicial commission consisting of royal officials.
Although the commission resorted equally to tortures during
the cross-examination, it was not able to wrest a confession
from the innocent Jewish prisoners. Nevertheless, being convinced
in advance of the correctness of the ritual libel, the
judges sentenced them to be burned at the stake, together with
the bodies of the preacher and elder, which had to be exhumed
for this purpose (1737).</p>

<p>The sentence had first to be ratified by the King, and the
Jewish representatives in Warsaw and Dresden, the latter city
being the second capital of the King and the residence of the
papal nuncio, employed every possible means to bring about
a reversal of the judgment. It was difficult to influence Augustus
III., the dull-witted monarch, who, in addition, was imbued
with a goodly dose of anti-Semitism. But the noise caused by
the trial at Posen and the pressure upon the King on the part of
the Jewish bankers of Vienna, particularly the banking-house
of Wertheimer, induced him to yield. After a prolonged
interval and a second revision of the case by a royal commission,
the King gave orders to free the Jews, who had languished in
prison for four years (August, 1740). On this occasion he
went out of his way to enjoin the magistracy of Posen not to
resort to tortures in similar trials, but he could not refrain
at the same time from prescribing to the Jews "rules of conduct"
after the medieval pattern: not to pass too frequently
beyond the boundaries of their ghetto (which had been preserved
in Posen), not to associate with Christians, nor caress
Christian children, nor keep Christian domestics, nor attend
Christian patients, etc.</p>

<p>The favorable issue of the Posen trial was due to the fact that
it took place in a large Jewish community, whose representatives
were able to arouse the public opinion of Western Europe
and secure the intervention of influential persons. But in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
distant corners of Poland, in the obscure Jewish communities
of the country, the ritual murder trials were in the nature of
ghastly nightmares. Such was the trial of Zaslav, a town in
Volhynia, which originated in 1747 as the result of a fatal
concatenation of events. In the springtime, when the snow
was melting, the dead body of a Christian was found in a
neighboring village, having been buried beneath the snow for a
considerable time. It so happened that about the same time the
functionaries of the Zaslav synagogue assembled in a neighboring
Jewish inn, to celebrate the circumcision of the new-born
son of the innkeeper. A peasant who chanced to pass by the
inn informed the authorities that the Jews had been praying
the whole night as well as eating and amusing themselves, and
this suggested to the Bernardine monks of Zaslav that the celebration
had some connection with ritual murder, the victim of
which was the discovered dead body. The Jewish innkeeper,
the Kahal elder, the <i>hazan</i> (cantor), the <i>mohel</i> (surgeon), and
the beadle of the Zaslav synagogue, were indicted. The accused,
in spite of dreadful tortures, reiterated that they had assembled
to celebrate a circumcision. Only the youthful beadle Moyshe,
crazed by the tortures, began to murmur something, repeating
the words which were dictated to him by the accusers, though
he afterwards withdrew the confession thus forced from him.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
The accused were all sentenced to a monstrous death, possible
only among savages. Some of the accused were placed
on an iron pale, which slowly cut into their body, and resulted
in a slow, torturous death. The others were treated with
equal cannibalism; their skin was torn off in strips, their
hearts cut out, their hands and feet amputated and nailed to
the gallows. The memorial prayer for these martyrs concludes
with the Biblical words: "O earth, cover not thou their blood,
and let their cry have no place, until the Lord shall look down
from heaven!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>However, the cry of the Zaslav martyrs was drowned by the
shouts of the new victims of the ritual murder myth, which
transformed the Christians who consciously or unconsciously
allowed themselves to be infected by its poison into cannibals.</p>

<p>The Zaslav trial was followed by an uninterrupted succession
of ritual murder accusations, which in the course of fifteen
years cropped up almost annually. The most revolting among
them, from the point of view of the surrounding circumstances,
were the trials of Dunaigrod<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> (1748), Pavolochi<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and Zhytomir
(1753), Yampol<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> (1756), Stupnitza, near Pshemyshl
(1759), and Voislavitza<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> (1760). In the Zhytomir case,
twenty-four Jews were accused of having participated in the
murder of the peasant boy Studzienski. Exhausted by tortures
and prompted by the desire to hasten their end, they confessed
to a crime which they had not committed, and were sentenced
to death. Eleven were flayed alive, while the others saved
themselves from death by accepting baptism. An image of the
alleged martyr Studzienski, in the shape of a figure covered
with pins, was spread by the clergy all over the region, to intensify
the hatred against the Jews. In Voislavitza, near Lublin,
the whole Kahal was charged with the murder of a Christian
boy for the purpose of squeezing out his blood and mixing it
with the unleavened bread. The spiritual leaders and elders of
the Jewish community were brought to court. One of the
accused, the rabbi, committed suicide while in jail. The
remaining four were sentenced to be quartered. Before the
execution the priest, holding out the promise of leniency,
induced the unfortunate Jews, who had been crazed by their
tortures, to embrace Christianity. The leniency consisted in
their being beheaded instead of being quartered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Terrorized by these inquisitorial trials, the Jewish communities
of Poland decided, in 1758, to send Jacob Zelig (or
Selek)<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> to Rome as their spokesman, to obtain from Pope Benedict
XIV. the promulgation of a bull forbidding these false
accusations against the Jews. In the application submitted
by Zelig it is pointed out that the life of the Jews of Poland
had become intolerable, for "as soon as a dead body is found
anywhere, at once the Jews of the neighboring localities are
brought before the courts on the charge of murder for superstitious
purposes." The application was turned over to Cardinal
Ganganelli, subsequently Pope Clement XIV., who took
up the matter very seriously, and suggested that the Papal
Nuncio in Warsaw, Visconti, be instructed to submit a report
of the recent ritual murder trials in Poland. When the
report arrived, Ganganelli composed an elaborate memorandum,
in which, as a result of his investigation of the whole history
of the question, he demonstrated the falsehood of the
ritual murder charges made against the Jews, which had been
condemned by the popes in the Middle Ages, particularly by
the bull of Innocent IV. of the year 1247.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> In the judgment
of Ganganelli all the recent Polish trials were devoid of any
basis in fact, and the sentences pronounced by the courts
revolting miscarriages of justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Ganganelli's memorandum was examined and approved by
the Roman tribunal of the "Holy Inquisition," and submitted
to the new Pope Clement XIII. The Pope instructed his nuncio
in Warsaw to extend his protection to Zelig, the spokesman
of the Jews, on his return to Poland. Subsequently the nuncio
informed the Polish Prime Minister Brühl, that "the Holy
See, having investigated all the foundations of this aberration,
according to which the Jews need human blood for
the preparation of their unleavened bread," had come to the
conclusion that "there was no evidence whatsoever testifying
to the correctness of that prejudice" (1763). King Augustus
III. ratified in the same year the ancient charters of his predecessors,
promising the Jews the protection of the law in all
ritual murder cases. Yet it was not easy to eradicate the
prejudices which had been implanted in the minds of the
people. Even the educated classes did not escape their contamination.
The contemporary writer Kitovich, in describing
Polish life during the reign of Augustus III., indulges in the
following remark: "Just as the liberty of the Shlakhta is
impossible without the <i>liberum veto</i>, so is the Jewish <i>matza</i>
impossible without Christian blood."</p>


<p>7. <span class="smcap">The Massacre of Uman and the First Partition
of Poland</span></p>

<p>Undermined by social and denominational strife, the once
flourishing country was hastening to its ruin. From the
election of Stanislav Augustus Poniatovski to the throne of
Poland in 1764, Poland was to all intents and purposes under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the protectorate of Russia. Certain elements of Polish society
began to realize that only by radical reforms could the country
be saved from its impending doom. But it seemed as if the
<i>régime</i> of social and religious fanaticism was too decrepit to
pass its own death-sentence, and awaited its fate from another
hand.</p>

<p>In the first years of Stanislav Augustus' reign Polish politics
ran in their accustomed groove. Instead of endeavoring
to effect a radical improvement in the condition of Polish
Jewry as one of the most important elements of the urban
population, the new Polish Government thought only of exploiting
them as much as possible for the benefit of the exchequer.
The Diet of 1764, which was held in Warsaw prior to
the election of the King, and discussed the question of internal
reforms, did not consider it necessary to introduce any changes
in the status of the Jews, except to alter the system of Jewish
taxation. Formerly the head-tax had been levied upon all
Polish and Lithuanian Jews annually in a round sum, which
the central Jewish agencies, the Waads, or Jewish Councils,
apportioned among the separate Kahals, and the latter, in
turn, allotted to the individual members of the communities.
According to the new "constitution," however, the head-tax,
to the extent of two gulden, was to be imposed on every Jewish
soul, and each Kahal was to be held responsible for the accurate
collection from its members. The only effect of this reform
was to swell the total amount of the head-tax, which as it was
weighed heavily upon the Jews, since many sources of livelihood
were closed to them at the same time.</p>

<p>The Shlakhta in turn zealously watched over its class
interests, and in electing the king imposed upon him the obligation
of barring the Jews from the stewardship of crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
domains, state taxes, and other financial revenues. To gratify
the hereditary competitors of the Jews&mdash;the Christian burghers
and merchants&mdash;the Diet of 1768 restored the clause of the
ancient parliamentary Constitution of 1538,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> by virtue of which
the Jews of those cities where they had not obtained special
privileges were allowed to engage in commerce only with
the consent of the magistracies, and the magistracies were
made up of those same Christian merchants and burghers.</p>

<p>In the meantime, among the Russian population of that
portion of the Ukraina which was situated on the right bank
of the Dnieper, and was still under the sovereignty of Poland,
a popular movement arose, which was directed simultaneously
against the Poles and the Jews. It emanated from the lowest
elements of the population, the enslaved village khlops,
who had not yet forgotten the times of Bogdan Khmelnitzki.
The memory of those days when the despised khlops waded
in the blood of the proud Polish pans and the Jews was still
fresh in the minds of the Ukrainians, and made itself felt in
moments of political unrest, not infrequent in the disintegrating
body politic of Poland. Fugitive Greek Orthodox
peasants from among the serfs of the pans, itinerant Zaporozhians,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
and Cossacks from the Russian part of the Ukraina,
often organized themselves in independent detachments of
haidamacks,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and indulged in looting the estates of the nobles
or plundering the Jewish towns. These incursions assumed
the character of regular insurrections during the interregnums
and on other occasions of political unrest. Thus, in 1734
and in 1750, detachments of haidamacks, fully organized
and led by Cossack commanders, devastated many towns and
villages in the provinces of Kiev, Volhynia, and Podolia, slaying
and robbing many pans and Jews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The haidamack movement of 1768 was particularly furious.
The Russian Government, which, beginning with the reign of
Stanislav Poniatovski, was practically in control of the affairs
of Poland, demanded that the "dissidents," the Greek Orthodox
subjects of the country, be granted not only complete
religious liberty, but also political equality. A considerable
part of the Polish Shlakhta and clergy objected to these
demands, and, seceding from the pro-Russian Government of
Poland, formed the famous Confederacy of Bar,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> for the defense
of the ancient religious and political order of things
against the encroachments of the foreigners. While the united
royal and Russian troops were fighting against the Confederates,
dissatisfaction was brewing among the Greek Orthodox
peasants of the Polish Ukraina. Agitators from among the
Orthodox clergy and the Zaporozhians instigated the peasants
to rise for their faith against the Poles, who had formed the
Confederacy of Bar for the annihilation of Greek Orthodoxy.
A fictitious decree of the Russian Empress Catherine II., known
as "the golden Charter," circulated among the people from
hand to hand, giving orders "to exterminate the Poles and
the Jews, the desecrators of our holy religion," in the Ukraina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>The new haidamack movement was headed by the Zaporozhian
Cossack Zheleznyak. Beginning with the month of
April of 1768, the rebellious hordes of Zheleznyak raged
within the borders of the present Government of Kiev, murdering
the pans and the Jews and devastating towns and
estates. The haidamacks were wont to hang a Pole, a Jew, and
a dog, on one tree, and to place upon the tree the inscription:
"Lakh,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Zhyd,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and hound&mdash;all to the same faith bound." A
terrible massacre of Jews was perpetrated by the haidamacks in
the towns of Lysyanka and Tetyev, in the province of Kiev.</p>

<p>From there Zheleznyak's hordes moved towards Uman,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> an
important fortified town, whither, at the first rumor of the
rebellion, tens of thousands of Poles and Jews had fled for
their lives. The place was crowded with refugees to such an
extent that the newly-arrived could find no room in the town
itself, and had to camp in tents outside. Uman belonged to
the estate of the Voyevoda of Kiev, a member of the famous
Pototzki family, and was commanded by a governor called
Mladanovich. Mladanovich had at his disposal a Cossack detachment
of the court guard under the command of Colonel
Gonta. Despite the fact that Gonta had long been suspected of
sympathizing with the haidamacks, Mladanovich saw fit to
dispatch him with a regiment of these court Cossacks against
Zheleznyak, who was approaching the city. As was to be
expected, Gonta went over to Zheleznyak, and on June 18,
1768, both commanders turned around and, at the head of their
armies, marched upon Uman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>During the first day the city was defended by the Polish
pans and the Jews, who worked shoulder to shoulder on the
city wall, fighting off the besiegers with cannon and rifles.
But not all Poles were genuinely resolved to defend the city.
Many of them merely thought of saving their lives. Governor
Mladanovich himself conducted peace negotiations with the
haidamacks, and was reconciled by their assurances that they
would not lay hands on the pans, but would be satisfied
with making short work of the Jews. When the haidamacks,
headed by Gonta and Zheleznyak, had penetrated into the
town, they threw themselves, in accordance with their promise,
upon the Jews, who, crazed with terror, were running to and
fro in the streets. They were murdered in beastlike fashion,
being trampled under the hoofs of the horses, or hurled
down from the roofs of the houses, while children were impaled
on bayonets, and women were violated. A crowd of Jews to the
number of some three thousand sought refuge behind the
walls of the great synagogue. When the haidamacks approached
the sacred edifice, several Jews, maddened with fury,
hurled themselves with daggers and knives upon the front
ranks of the enemy and killed a few men. The remaining Jews
did nothing but pray to the Lord for salvation. To finish with
the Jews quickly, the haidamacks placed a cannon at the entrance
of the synagogue and blew up the doors, whereupon the
murderers rushed inside, turning the house of prayer into a
slaughter-house. Hundreds of dead bodies were soon swimming
in pools of blood.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the Jews, the haidamacks now proceeded
to deal with the Poles. Many of them were slaughtered in
their church. Mladanovich and all other pans suffered the
same fate. The streets of the city were strewn with corpses or
with mutilated, half-dead bodies. About twenty thousand
Poles and Jews perished during this memorable "Uman massacre."</p>

<p>Simultaneously smaller detachments of haidamacks and
mutinous peasants were busy exterminating the Shlakhta and
the Jews in other parts of the provinces of Kiev and Podolia.
Where formerly the hordes of Bogdan Khmelnitzki had raged,
Jewish blood was again flowing in streams, and the cries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Jewish martyrs were again heard. But this time the catastrophe
did not assume the same gigantic proportions as in
1648. Both the Polish and Russian troops co-operated in
suppressing the haidamack insurrection. Shortly after the
massacre of Uman, Zheleznyak and Gonta were captured by
order of the Russian General Krechetnikov. Gonta with his
detachment was turned over to the Polish Government, and
sentenced to be flayed alive and quartered. The other haidamack
detachments were either annihilated or taken prisoner
by the Polish commanders.</p>

<p>In this way the Jews of the Ukraina became a second time
the victims of typical Russian pogroms, the outgrowth of
national and caste antagonism, which was rending Poland
in twain. The year 1768 was a miniature copy of the year 1648.
A commonwealth in which for many centuries the relationship
between the various groups of citizens was determined by
mutual hatred, could not expect to survive as an independent
political organism. A country in which the nobility despised
the gentry, and both looked down with contempt upon the
calling of the merchant and the burgher, and enslaved the
peasant, in which the Catholic clergy was imbued with hatred
against the professors of all other creeds, in which the urban
population persecuted the Jews as business rivals, and the
peasants were filled with bitterness against both the higher
and the lower orders&mdash;such a country was bound to perish.
And Poland did perish.</p>

<p>The first partition of Poland took place in 1772, transferring
the Polish border provinces into the hands of the three
neighboring countries, Russia, Austria, and Prussia. Russia
received the southwestern border province: the larger part
of White Russia, the present Governments of Vitebsk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Moghilev. Austria took the southwestern region: a part of
present-day Galicia, with a strip of Podolia. Prussia seized
Pomerania and a part of Great Poland, constituting the
present province of Posen. The annexed provinces constituted
nearly a third of Polish territory, with a population of three
millions, comprising a quarter of a million Jews.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The great
Jewish center in Poland enters into the chaotic "partitional
period" (1772-1815). Out of this chaos there gradually
emerges a new Jewish center of the Diaspora&mdash;that of
Russia.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
THE INNER LIFE OF POLISH JEWRY DURING THE
PERIOD OF DECLINE</h2>


<p>1. <span class="smcap">Jewish Self-Government</span></p>

<p>The fact that the Jews of Poland, despite the general disintegration
of the country, where right was supplanted by
privilege and liberty by license, were yet able to hold their own
as an organized social unit, was principally due to that vast
scheme of communal self-government which had become an
integral part of Polish-Jewish life during the preceding period.
Surrounded by enemies, ostracized by all other estates and
social groups, Polish Jewry, guided by the instinct of self-preservation,
endeavored to close its ranks and gather sufficient
inner strength to offer effective resistance to the hostile non-Jewish
world. One of the appeals issued in 1676 by the central
organ of Polish Jewry, the "Council of the Four Lands,"
begins with these characteristic words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Gravely have we sinned before the Lord. The unrest grows
from day to day. It becomes more and more difficult to live.
Our people has no standing whatsoever among the nations. Indeed,
it is a miracle that in spite of all misfortunes we are still
alive. The only thing left for us to do is to unite ourselves in one
league, held together by the spirit of strict obedience to the commandments
of God and to the precepts of our pious teachers and
leaders.</p></div>

<p>These sentences are followed by a set of paragraphs calling
upon the Jews of Poland to obey without murmuring
the mandates of their Kahals, to refrain from farming state
taxes, from accepting the stewardship of Shlakhta estates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and entering into business partnership with non-Jews without
the permission of the Kahals, for the reason that such enterprises
are bound to result in conflicts with the Christian population
and in complaints on their part about the Jews. The
Council also forbids "intrusting Jewish goods to strange
hands," resorting to the intervention of the Polish authorities
for purposes injurious to the interests of the community, generating
schisms and party strife among Jews, and similar
actions.</p>

<p>The rabbinical Kahal administration endeavored to impose
its will upon every single member of the community by regulating
his economic and spiritual life, and to prevent as far as
possible his coming in contact with the outside world. The
greatest assistance in this endeavor came from the Polish Government.
Attaching great value to the Kahal as a convenient
tool for the collection of Jewish taxes, the Government bestowed
upon it vast administrative and judicial powers. The Government
found it to its interest to deal with the Jewish communities
rather than with individual Jews. The Kahal was
held responsible by the Government for the action of every one
of its members or for any inaccuracy of the latter in the payment
of taxes. The Kahal extended its influence in proportion
to its responsibility. This tutelage of the Kahal
resulted in strengthening the social organization of the Jews,
while it curbed at the same time the personal liberty of its
members to a greater extent than was demanded even by the
strictest social discipline.</p>

<p>As far as the Polish Government was concerned, the Kahal
was particularly valued as a responsible collecting agency
among the Jews on behalf of the exchequer. At the sessions of
the Waads, the wholesale amount of the Jewish head-tax (designated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
as <i>gulgoleth</i> in the Jewish sources) was periodically
fixed and apportioned among the Kahal districts. Within these
Kahal districts as well as in the individual communities the
apportionment of the taxes was the function of the local Kahal
elders, who were in charge of the tax collection, and were held
responsible for its being accurately remitted to the exchequer.
In 1672 the King bestowed upon the Kahal elders of Lithuania
the right of excluding from the community or of punishing
by other measures those recalcitrant members of their Kahals
who by their acts were likely to arouse the resentment of the
Christian population against the Jews. Ten years later the
Starosta of Brest issued a rescript forbidding the pans to lend
money to private persons among the Jews without the knowledge
of the Kahal elders. This was done in compliance with the
request of these elders themselves, since they were held responsible
for the insolvent debtors of their respective districts. On
a previous occasion, at a conference of the representatives of the
Lithuanian communities held in 1670, it was decided to prosecute
every Jew who borrowed money from the pans or priests
without the knowledge of their Kahal. The Voyevoda of Lemberg
in 1692 forbade letting the collection of various state
imposts, such as the excise on distilleries and retail sale of
spirits, to Jews unless they produced a certificate of the Kahal
elders testifying to their good conduct. The right of owning
real estate or exploiting articles of revenue (leases and land-rent)
was granted to private persons only with the permission
of the Kahal (<i>hazaka</i>). Without this license and the payment
of a special tax (<i>hezkath yishub</i>) no Jew was allowed
to settle in a given locality or to enroll his name in the
community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The limits of Jewish communal autonomy were not precisely
laid down by the law of the state. They were enlarged
or contracted in accordance with the will of the provincial
administration, the voyevodas and starostas,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> and the agreements
between these officials and the Kahals concerning their
respective spheres of influence. The model of a free communal
constitution may be found in the statute granted by the
Voyevoda of Red Russia (Galicia) in 1692 to the central Kahal
of Lemberg. This statute authorizes the Jewish community
to hold periodic elections, to choose its elders "in accordance
with its customs and rights," without the slightest
interference on the part of the local administration. The
chosen elders are recognized as the lawful officials and judges
of their coreligionists in a given locality. Disputes and litigation
between Jew and Jew are in the first instance to be settled
exclusively by the Kahal court (<i>beth-din</i>), consisting of rabbis
and elders, the latter acting as a jury. Cases between Jews
and non-Jews as well as appeals from the decisions of the
Beth-Din are to be tried by the voyevoda court and the special
"Jewish judge" attached to it, the latter being a Christian
official especially appointed for such cases. This judge is to be
selected by the voyevoda from two candidates nominated by the
Jewish elders. His function is to settle disputes and complaints
"in a definite place near the synagogue" (in the
"Kahal chamber"), in the presence of the Kahal elders. In
his verdicts the "Jewish judge" is to be guided not only by the
general laws of the state, but also by the Jewish common law.
The regular sessions of the court are to take place twice a week.
In special cases extra sessions may be arranged for on any day
with the exception of the Jewish holidays. Subpoenas are
issued through the synagogue beadle, or <i>shamash</i>.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The
protocols of the court are to be kept in the Kahal chamber near
the synagogue. The appeals from the judgments of this court
are to be submitted to the voyevoda himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The elections of the various grades of Kahal elders<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> were
held, as in former years, annually during the intermediate
days of Passover. This custom had legal sanction, and was
enforced by the local authorities. When, in 1719, the elders
of the Kahal of Brest, prompted by personal considerations,
were, in spite of the approach of Passover, delaying the
holding of new elections, the Lithuanian hetman<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> sent an order
from Vilna branding the act of the Kahal of Brest as illegal,
on the ground that, "though obliged by law and custom to hold
new elections of elders every Passover, they have not done so,
delaying the elections for their own personal benefit."</p>

<p>The elections were indirect, taking place through a limited
number of electors, and only persons of fairly high financial
standing, such as house-owners or large tax-payers, were
allowed to be candidates. As a matter of fact, intellectual
qualifications were no less valued than financial standing,
scholars occupying an honorable place in the communal
council.</p>

<p>The Kahal administration was thus oligarchic in character.
The lower and poorer classes had no representation in it, and,
as a result, their interests frequently suffered. In the eighteenth
century complaints, coming from the Jewish rank and
file, are constantly heard about the oppression of the Kahal
"bosses," about the inequitable apportionment of taxes, and
similar abuses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>During the same period litigation between individual Kahals
frequently arose concerning the boundaries of their respective
districts. This litigation was due to the fact that the Jewish
residents of the townlets and villages were subject to the jurisdiction
of the nearest Kahal, whose income they helped to
swell. Since, however, the Kahal districts had never been
officially delimited, several Kahals would occasionally lay
claim to the control of the neighboring townlets and settlements
(called in Hebrew <i>sebiboth</i> and <i>yishubim</i>, and in the
official language <i>prikahalki</i><a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>). Cases of this kind were brought
either before the conferences of the District Kahals or the
two central parliamentary institutions of Polish Jewry, the
"Council of the Four Lands" and the "Council of the Principal
Communities of Lithuania."</p>

<p>The centralization of Jewish self-government in these two
Councils&mdash;that of the Crown and of Lithuania&mdash;was one of the
main factors in stabilizing Jewish autonomy during that
period of instability and disintegration. The meetings or
Diets of these Councils, which were attended by the representatives
of the Kahals and the rabbinate, afforded a regular opportunity
for discussing the questions affecting the general
welfare of the Polish Jews and for establishing well-defined
relations with the Government and the Diets of the country.
Attached to the Waads were special advocates (<i>shtadlans</i>,
designated as "general syndics" in the Polish documents),
who went to Warsaw during the sessions of the Polish Chamber
for the purpose of submitting the necessary applications in
defense of Jewish rights or of presenting the taxation lists of
the Jewish communities. The Waad of the Crown continued
to meet periodically in Lublin, and Yaroslav (in Galicia), and
occasionally in other places, while the Lithuanian Council
assembled in different towns in Lithuania.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>The activity of these central agencies of self-government
was particularly intensified in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, when the state of communal affairs, sorely
shaken during the preceding period of unrest, had to be
restored. The Government upheld the authority of the Waads
in the eyes of the Jewish population, finding it more convenient
to maintain relations with one or two central organizations
than to deal with a large number of local agencies. In 1687 the
"Jewish Elders of the Crown" (of Poland proper), acting
on behalf of the Council at Yaroslav, lodged a complaint with
King Sobieski, declaring themselves unable to assume the
responsibility for the collection of the Jewish head-tax to the
amount fixed by the preceding Polish Diet, owing to the fact
that many Jews in the cities and villages, benefiting by the protection
of the pans and even the royal officials, refused to
acknowledge the jurisdiction of the "Elders of the Crown"
and shirked their duty as tax-payers. In view of this, the King
issued a decree condemning in strong terms "such interference
and disorder," and enjoining the individual Kahals to submit
to the apportionment of taxes by the Elders of the Crown, and
altogether to acknowledge their jurisdiction in general Jewish
affairs, under the pain of severe fines for the disobedient.</p>

<p>The gradual deterioration of social and economic conditions
in Poland rendered the activities of the Waads more complicated.
The Waads were now called upon to regulate also the
inner affairs of the communities as well as their relations to the
Government and the urban estates, the magistracies and guilds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
It cannot be said that the Waads exhibited on all occasions an
adequate understanding of the political situation, or that they
did full justice to the far-reaching demands of a truly popular
representation. They were too little democratic in their composition
to accomplish so large a task. The delegates to the
Waads were not elected by the communities with this end in
view, but were recruited from among the rabbis and elders of
the principal communities, the notables and "influential men."
However, in spite of their inadequate, oligarchic organization,
the Waads were largely instrumental in unifying communal
Jewish life and in enhancing discipline in Polish-Lithuanian
Jewry.</p>

<p>One of the most important duties of the Waads was the
maintenance of Jewish public schools, the Talmud Torahs and
yeshibahs, which at communal expense imparted religious
instruction primarily to poor children and youths. From
the minutes of the Lithuanian Waad which have come down
to us we learn of the fact that every one of its conferences
placed at the head of its enactments a number of clauses providing
for the obligatory instruction of the young in yeshibahs
throughout the country, for the maintenance of the students
by the various communities in cash and in kind, and for the
formulation of the curricula and the statutes of all these institutions
of learning. No wonder that the endeavors of the Waad
were crowned with success, and that the intellectual level of the
Jews of Lithuania was very high. It must be owned, however,
that their mental horizon was not large, inasmuch as the whole
course of study, even in the highest schools, was limited to the
Talmud and rabbinic literature.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Council of the Four Lands established a
control over the books issued by the printing-presses of Cracow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and Lublin, or imported from abroad. Only such books were
allowed to circulate as were supplied with a printed approbation,
or <i>haskama</i>, of the Waad or some authoritative rabbis.
Very frequently the Waad also intervened in the struggle of
parties and sects which, as will be seen later,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> followed the rise
of the Sabbatian movement.</p>

<p>Many public functions which lay outside the sphere of
activity of the central Waads were discharged by the local
District conventions, or "Dietines" (<i>waade medinah</i>, or <i>waade
galil</i>), the latter acting as the agencies of the Kahal federations
of the given region. In official language these District federations
were often designated as "synagogues." Especially
prominent during this period were the "Volhynian Synagogue,"
<i>i. e.</i> the federation of the Kahals of Volhynia, and
the "White Russian Synagogue," composed of the federated
communities of the present Government of Moghilev. The
former sent its representatives to the Council of the Four
Lands, while the latter was affiliated with the Waad of Lithuania.
The periodic conventions of these two "synagogues"
not only decided the allotment of taxes within the Kahal districts,
but also took up questions of a general character, such
as the sending of advocates to the general Polish Diet, the
instructions to be given to the deputies of the central Waads,
the problem of Jewish education, the rabbinate, etc. Less
noticeable was the activity of the Kahal federations of the three
"Crown provinces": Little Poland with the central community
of Cracow, Great Poland with Posen, and Red Russia
with Lemberg. We know, however, that they too assembled
periodically, either at the initiative of the Kahals themselves
or by order of the voyevoda of a given province. These
conventions or "Dietines" had their "floor leaders" or "marshals,"
after the pattern of the provincial Polish Diets. At
least such was the insistent demand of the voyevodas, who
preferred to transact their official business with the responsible
leaders of the conferences. The interference of the administration
in the affairs of the Jewish autonomous organization
became particularly frequent in the first part of the eighteenth
century, when political anarchy in Poland reached its climax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>The whole Kahal organization received a severe blow at the
hands of the Polish Government in 1764. The General Confederacy
which preceded the election of King Stanislav
Augustus, having framed a new "constitution," decided to
change fundamentally the system of Jewish taxation. Instead
of the former procedure of fixing the amount of the head-tax
<i>in toto</i>, and leaving its allotment to the Districts and individual
communities to the conferences of the elders and Kahals, the
Diet passed a resolution imposing a uniform tax of two gulden
on every registered Jewish soul of either sex, beginning
with the first year after birth. This change was justified on the
ground that, in the opinion of the Government, the previous
wholesale system of taxation enabled the Kahals to collect from
the tax-payers a much larger sum than originally determined
upon. Moreover, simultaneously with the head-tax other imposts
were levied by the Kahals. This resulted in burdening
the Jewish population and in hiding its true tax-paying capacity
from the Government, while according to the new system
the exchequer was likely to receive a much larger revenue.</p>

<p>To secure the accurate collection of the head-tax, a general
registration of the Jewish population in the whole country
was ordered. The taxes of each community were to be remitted
by its Kahal elders to the nearest state treasury. In consequence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the functions of the Kahals, as far as the apportionment
of the taxes was concerned, were officially discontinued,
and the Kahal elders became mere go-betweens, who handed
over the tax revenues to the exchequer. The Government ceased
to recognize the rôle of the Kahal as a fiscal agent, which it
had formerly valued so greatly, and no more considered it
necessary to uphold the authority of this autonomous organization.
The whole machinery of Jewish self-government, all
these Diets and Dietines, the Waads and District conferences,
suddenly became superfluous, if not injurious, in the eyes of
the Government. No wonder then that the same Diet of 1764
passed a resolution forbidding henceforth the holding of conventions
of District elders for the fixation or distribution of
any tax collections or for any other purpose.</p>

<p>This limitation of the activities of the Kahals and the entire
abolition of the central agencies of Jewish autonomy took place
on the eve of the abolition of political independence in Poland
itself, eight years before its first partition. We shall see later
that the subsequent period of unrest, marked by the transfer
of the greater part of Polish territory to the dominion
of Russia, introduced even greater disorder into the once so
firmly consolidated autonomous organization of the Jews, and
robbed the Jewish people of one of the mainstays of its
national existence.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">Rabbinical and Mystical Literature</span></p>

<p>The social and economic decline of the Polish Jews, which set
in after 1648, was not conducive to widening the Jewish mental
horizon, which had been sharply defined during the preceding
epoch. Even at the time when Polish-Jewish culture was
passing through its zenith, Rabbinism reigned supreme in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
school and literature. Needless to say there was no chance
for any broader intellectual currents to contest this supremacy
during the ensuing period of decline. The only rival of Rabbinism,
whose attitude was now peaceful and now warlike,
was Mysticism, which was nurtured by the mournful disposition
of a life-worn people, and grew into maturity in the
unwholesome atmosphere of Polish decadence.</p>

<p>The intensive Talmudic culture, which had been fostered by
many generations of rabbis and rosh-yeshibahs was not distributed
evenly. In those parts of the country which had suffered
most from the horrors of the "terrible decade" (1648-1658),
in the Polish Ukraina, Podolia, and Volhynia, the intellectual
level of the Jewish masses sank lower and lower.
Talmudic learning, which was formerly widespread among
the Jews of those provinces, now became the possession of a
narrow circle of scholars, while the lower classes were stagnating
in ignorance and superstition. A firmer position was still
held by Rabbinism in Lithuania and in the original provinces
of Poland. But here too the intellectual activity became pettier
and poorer, not so much in quantity as in quality. It is still
possible to enumerate a large number of names of great Talmudists
and rabbis, who commanded the respect and admiration
not only of the Jews of Poland but also of those outside
of it. But in the domain of literary productivity these scholars
did not leave so profound an impress on posterity as their
predecessors, Solomon Luria, Moses Isserles, Mordecai Jaffe,
and Meïr of Lublin.</p>

<p>Even within the narrow sphere of the rabbinic literary output
originality was sadly missing. The "stars" of Rabbinism
who were engaged in learned correspondence (<i>Shaaloth
u-Teshuboth</i>) with one another were, as a rule, immersed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
fruitless controversies about complicated and petty cases of
religious and legal practice, frequently degenerating into the
discussion of questions which do not arise in real life. Others
wrote diffuse hair-splitting commentaries and <i>novellae</i> (<i>hiddushim</i>)
on various tractates of the Talmud, including those
which had long lost all legal significance. Thus Aaron
Samuel Kaidanover, Rabbi of Cracow, who had narrowly
escaped the massacres of 1648, commented on the section dealing
with the sacrifices and the ancient ritual of the temple in
Jerusalem (<i>Birkhath ha-Zebah</i><a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>). Still others wrote annotations
and supplements to the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Lithuania, in
particular, excelled by the number of its celebrities in the field
of rabbinic scholasticism, all men who refused to acknowledge
any branch of secular and even religious knowledge outside the
domain of Talmudic dialectics.</p>

<p>A rare exception among these scholars was Jehiel Halperin
(ab. 1670-1746), rabbi of Minsk, who wrote an extensive historic
chronicle under the name of <i>Seder ha-Doroth</i>, "The Order
of the Generations." Halperin's work, which is divided into
three parts, narrates in the first the events of Jewish history
from Biblical times down to the year 1696. The second part
enumerates, in alphabetical order, the names of all the Tannaim
and Amoraim,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and cites the opinions and sayings attributed to
each of them in the Talmud. The third part contains a list of
authors and books of the post-Talmudic period. The original
contribution of Halperin consists in his having systematized
the extremely complicated material, and rendered
it available for a characterization of the Talmudic rabbis. In
all else he merely copied earlier chroniclers, particularly
David Gans,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> without any attempt at a critical analysis. He
even fails to render account of such important events of his
own time as the Messianic movement of Sabbatai Zevi. The
essence of history to him is identical with the genealogies of
scholars, saints, and rabbis; the only reason for existence which
in his judgment historiography may claim is to serve as the
handmaid of Rabbinism. Even this outlook upon history,
narrow though it be, was entirely foreign to Halperin's contemporaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Side by side with the scholastic literature of Rabbinism
flourished popular ethical literature (<i>musar</i><a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>). Its originators
were the preachers (<i>darshanim</i>), some of whom occupied permanent
posts attached to synagogues, while others wandered
about from town to town. The synagogue sermons of that
period, which have come down to us in various collections,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> consist
of a long string of Haggadic and Cabalistic quotations, by
means of which the Biblical texts are given an entirely perverted
meaning. The preachers were evidently less anxious
to instruct their audience than to exhibit their enormous
erudition in theological literature. Some of these preachers endeavored
in particular to foist upon the people the notions
of the "Practical Cabala."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The "secret" writings of
Ari<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and his school were circulated in Poland in manuscript
copies, which went from hand to hand. The ideas embodied in
the Cabalistic doctrine of Ari were popularized in the shape
of "gruesome stories" concerning life after death, the tortures
of the sinners in hell, the transmigration of souls, and the
exploits of demons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The books which endeavored to inculcate piety among the
masses by means of these stories became rapidly popular.
Towards the end of the seventeenth century, the Cabalist
Joseph Dubno wrote a work in this spirit under the title
<i>Yesod Yoseph</i>, "Foundation of Joseph." Prior to its publication,
Dubno's work was utilized by Hirsch Kaidanover, a son
of the above-mentioned rabbi of Cracow, Aaron Samuel
Kaidanover,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and issued by him in an improved and amplified
version in Frankfort-on-the-Main, in 1705, under the name
<i>Kab ha-Yashar</i>, "The Just Measure." A few years later the
book was published also in the Yiddish vernacular, and became
a great favorite among the lower classes as well as among
women.</p>

<p>The <i>Kab ha-Yashar</i> breathes a spirit of gloomy asceticism,
and is expressive of a funereal frame of mind. "O man,"&mdash;the
author exclaims&mdash;"wert thou to know how many demons
thirst for thy blood, thou wouldst abandon thyself entirely,
with heart and soul, to Almighty God!" The air, according
to the doctrine preached in this book, is filled with the invisible
spirits of the dead who can find no rest in the other world,
and teems with the wandering shadows of sinners and demons,
who frequently slip into living beings and force them to rage
like madmen. Scores of "reliable" stories are quoted, telling
of the conflicts between men and demons and of the exploits of
miracle-workers who have exorcised the evil spirits by means of
incantations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>Prominent among these stories is an account of the expulsion
of devils from a house in Posen, which produced a great
sensation at the time. Evil spirits had been constantly haunting
the inhabitants of the house. At first they sought advice
of the local Jesuit priests. When the remedy employed
by the latter proved of no avail, the inhabitants invited the
famous magician and miracle-worker Joel Baal-Shem<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> from
Zamoshch.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The miracle-worker subjected the demons to a
regular cross-examination, demanding an explanation why
they refused to abandon the ill-fated house. At the cross-examination
the demons argued that the house was theirs by
inheritance, inasmuch as they were the legitimate children
of the former owner of the house, a Jewish artisan who had
had relations with a female devil. As a result, a conference of
the rabbis of Posen was held in the presence of the above-mentioned
miracle-worker, and their verdict was that the
demons had no claim to immovable property in places populated
by human beings, but were limited in their right of
residence to forests and deserts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the spiritual pabulum on which the Jewish masses
were fed by their leaders. A writer of the beginning of the
eighteenth century makes the observation, that "there is no
country where the Jews are so much given to mystical fancies,
devil hunting, talismans, and exorcism of evil spirits, as they
are in Poland." The demand brought forth a supply, and
even the celebrated rabbis frequently devoted themselves to
Cabalistic exercises. One of these was the Rabbi of Ostrog and
Posen, Naphtali Cohen (1640-1719), of whom the following
curious incident is related. After settling in Frankfort-on-the-Main,
he made the people believe that he had discovered a
magic formula against fire. As luck would have it, a fire broke
out in his own house, and destroyed a considerable part of the
Jewish quarter. The ill-fated Cabalist was sent to jail on the
charge of careless handling of fire during his pyrotechnic
experiments (1711). After his release from prison Naphtali
Cohen led the life of a wanderer, entering into suspicious relations
with Hayyun, the notorious emissary of the Sabbatian
sect, though afterwards, when Hayyun's heresy had been unmasked
in Amsterdam, he renounced all connection with the
heretic. During the contest which for many years was waged
by Emden against Eibeshütz and his mysterious talismans,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> the
majority of Polish rabbis sided with Eibeshütz. Evidently
they found nothing objectionable in the attempt to cure diseases
by means of cabalistically inscribed talismans.</p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap">The Sabbatian Movement</span></p>

<p>The mystical and sectarian tendencies which were in vogue
among the masses of Polish Jewry were the outcome of the
Messianic movement, which, originated by Sabbatai Zevi in
1648, spread like wildfire throughout the whole Jewish world.
The movement made a particularly deep impression in Poland,
where the mystical frame of mind of the Polish-Jewish
masses offered a favorable soil for it. It was more than a
mere coincidence that one and the same year, 1648, was marked
by the wholesale murder of the Jews of the Ukraina and the
first public appearance of Sabbatai Zevi in Smyrna. The
thousands of Jewish captives, who in the summer of that
terrible year had been carried to Turkey by the Tatar allies
of Khmelnitzki and ransomed there by their coreligionists,
conveyed to the minds of the Oriental Jews an appalling
impression of the destruction of the great Jewish center in
Poland. There can be no doubt that the descriptions of
this catastrophe deeply affected the impressionable mind of
Sabbatai, and prepared the soil for the success of the propaganda
he carried on during his wanderings in Turkey, Palestine,
and Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>When, in the year 1666, the whole Jewish world resounded
with the fame of Sabbatai Zevi as the Messianic liberator of
the Jewish people, the Jews of Poland responded with particularly
keen, almost morbid sensitiveness.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Jews&mdash;says the contemporary Ukrainian writer Galatovski&mdash;triumphed.
Some abandoned their houses and property, refusing
to do any work and claiming that the Messiah would soon
arrive and carry them on a cloud to Jerusalem. Others fasted for
days, denying food even to their little ones, and during that severe
winter bathed in ice-holes, at the same time reciting a recently-composed
prayer. Faint-hearted and destitute Christians, hearing
the stories of the miracles performed by the false Messiah and
beholding the boundless arrogance of the Jews, began to doubt
Christ.</p></div>

<p>From the South, the Sabbatian agitation penetrated to the
North, to distant White Russia. We are informed by a
contemporary monastic chronicler, that on the walls of the
churches in Moghilev on the Dnieper mysterious inscriptions
appeared proclaiming the Jewish Messiah "Sapsai."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of the eventful year in which the whole Jewish
world raved about the coming of the Messiah and deputations
arrived from all over the Jewish world at the "Castle of
Splendor," Sabbatai's residence in Abydos, near Constantinople,
a delegation was also dispatched by the Jews of
Poland. In this delegation were included Isaiah, the son of
David Halevi, the famous rabbi of Lemberg, author of the
Taz,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and the grandson of another celebrity, Joel Sirkis.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The
Polish delegates were sent, as it were, on a scouting expedition,
being instructed to investigate on the spot the correctness
of the rumors concerning the Messianic claims of Sabbatai.</p>

<p>When, in the summer of 1666, they were presented to Sabbatai
at Abydos, they were deeply impressed by the sight of the
thousands of enthusiastic admirers who had come from all
possible countries to render homage to him. Sabbatai handed
the Polish delegates an enigmatic letter, addressed to the Rabbi
of Lemberg:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the sixth day after the resuscitation of my spirit and light,
on the twenty-second of Tammuz.... I herewith send a gift to
the man of faith, the venerable old man, Rabbi David of the house
of Levi, the author of <i>Ture Zahab</i>&mdash;may he flourish in his old age
in strength and freshness! Soon will I avenge you and comfort
you, even as a mother comforteth her son, and recompense you a
hundredfold [for the sufferings endured by you]. The day of revenge
is in my heart, and the year of redemption hath arrived.
Thus speaketh David, the son of Jesse, the head of all the kings of
the earth.... the Messiah of the God of Jacob, the Lion of the
mountain recesses, Sabbatai Zevi.</p></div>

<p>The gift referred to in the letter consisted of a shirt which
Sabbatai handed over to Rabbi David's son, with the instruction
to put it on his aged and feeble father and recite at the
same time the words, "May thy youth be renewed like that of
the eagle!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Having learned from the delegates that a Cabalistic propagandist,
by the name of Nehemiah Cohen, who predicted the
coming of the Messiah, had appeared in Poland, Sabbatai
added a postscript to his letter in which he asked that this
"prophet," being the forerunner of the Messiah, be sent to
him speedily. The omniscient Messiah failed to foresee that
this invitation spelled ruin for him. It is generally conceded
that the interview between Nehemiah, the Cabalistic fanatic,
and Sabbatai was one of the causes that accelerated the downfall
of the Messiah. After a Cabalistic argument with Sabbatai,
which lasted three days, Nehemiah refused to acknowledge
him as the expected Messiah. While in Adrianople he
revealed Sabbatai's plans to the Turkish authorities, and this
led to the arrest of the pseudo-Messiah and his feigned conversion
to Islam.</p>

<p>The news of the hideous desertion of Judaism by the redeemer
of the Jewish people was slow in reaching the Jews
of Poland, and when it did reach them, only a part of his
adherents felt it their duty to abandon him. The more
credulous rank and file remained steadfast in their loyalty,
hoping for further miracles, to be performed by the mysterious
savior of Judaism, who had "put on the turban" temporarily
in order to gain the confidence of the Sultan and afterwards to
dethrone him. When Sabbatai died, Poland witnessed the
same transformation of political into mystical Messianism
which was taking place at the time in Western Europe.</p>

<p>The proximity to Turkey and to the city of Saloniki, the
headquarters of the Sabbatian sect, lent particular intensity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the sectarian movement in Poland, fomenting a spiritual agitation
in the Jewish masses from the end of the seventeenth
down to the end of the eighteenth century. The main center
of the movement came to be in Podolia, part of which had been
annexed by Turkey, after the Polish-Turkish War of 1672, and
was returned to Poland only in 1699 by the Peace Treaty of
Carlowitz.</p>

<p>The agitators and originators of these sects were recruited
partly from among the obscure masses, partly from among the
Cabalists whose minds were befogged. At the end of the
seventeenth century, a Lithuanian Jew by the name of Zadok,
a plain, ignorant man, who had been an innkeeper, began to
prophesy that the Messiah would appear in 1695. About the
same time a more serious propagandist of the Messianic idea
appeared in the person of the Cabalist Hayyim Malakh. Having
resided in Turkey, where he had been in contact with the
Sabbatian circle in Saloniki, Malakh returned to Poland and
began to muddle the heads of the Jews. He secretly preached
that Sabbatai Zevi was the Messiah, and that, like Moses,
who had kept the Israelites in the desert for forty years before
bringing them to the borders of the Promised Land, he would
rise from the dead and redeem the Jewish people in 1706, forty
years after his conversion.</p>

<p>Malakh's propaganda proved successful, particularly among
the ignorant masses of Podolia and Galicia. Malakh was soon
joined by another agitator, Judah Hasid, from Shidlovitz or
Shedletz.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Having studied Practical Cabala in Italy, Judah
Hasid returned to his native land and began to initiate the
studious Polish youths into this hidden wisdom. The circle of
his pupils and adherents grew larger and larger, and became
consolidated in a special sect, which called itself "the Pious,"
or <i>Hasidim</i>. The members of this sect engaged in ascetic exercises;
in anticipation of the Messiah, they made public confession
of their sins and inserted mystical prayers in their
liturgy. Hayyim Malakh joined the circle of Judah Hasid,
and brought over to it his Sabbatian followers. The number
of "the Pious" grew so large that the Orthodox rabbis became
alarmed and began to persecute them. Under the effect of
these persecutions the leaders of the sect started a propaganda
for a mass-emigration to Palestine, there to welcome in triumph
the approaching Messiah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>Many Jews were carried away by this propaganda. In the
beginning of 1700, a troop of one hundred and twenty pilgrims
started on their way, under the joint leadership of Judah
Hasid and Hayyim Malakh. The emigrants traveled in
groups, by way of Germany, Austria, and Italy, stopping in
various cities, where their leaders, dressed, after the manner of
penitent sinners, in white shrouds, delivered fiery exhortations,
in which they announced the speedy arrival of the Messiah.
The lower classes and the women were particularly impressed
by the speeches of the rigorously ascetic Judah Hasid. On
the road the Polish wanderers were joined by other groups of
Jews desirous of visiting the Holy Land, so that the number of
the travelers reached 1300 souls. One party of emigrants, led
by Hayyim Malakh, was dispatched, with the help of charitable
Jews of Vienna, from that city to Constantinople. Another
party, headed by Judah Hasid, traveled to Palestine by way
of Venice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>After much suffering and many losses on the journey, during
which several hundred died or remained behind, one thousand
reached Jerusalem. On arriving at their destination the new-comers
experienced severe disappointment. One of the leaders,
Judah Hasid, died shortly after their arrival in the Holy City.
His adherents were cooped up in some courtyard, and depended
on the gifts of charitable Jews. The destitute inhabitants of
Jerusalem, themselves living on the charity of their European
brethren, were not in a position to support the pilgrims, who
soon found themselves without means of subsistence. Disillusioned
and discouraged, the sectarians rapidly dispersed
in all directions. Some joined the ranks of the Turkish Sabbatians,
who posed as Mohammedans. Others returned to
Western Europe and Poland, mystifying credulous people with
all kinds of wild tales. Still others in their despair let themselves
be persuaded by German missionaries to embrace Christianity.
Hayyim Malakh, the second leader of the pilgrims,
remained in Jerusalem for some time with a handful of his
adherents. In this circle symbolic services, patterned after the
ritual of the Sabbatians, were secretly held, and, as rumor had
it, the sectarians performed dances before a wooden image of
Sabbatai Zevi. Having been forced to leave Jerusalem, the
dangerous heretic traveled about in Turkey, where he maintained
relations with sectarian circles. After being banished
from Constantinople by the rabbis, Hayyim Malakh returned to
his native country, and renewed his propaganda in Podolia and
Galicia. He died about 1720.</p>

<p>The ill success of the "Hasidim" failed to check the spread
of sectarianism in Poland. In Galicia and Podolia, the conventicles
of "Secret Sabbatians," dubbed by the people "Shabsitzvinnikes"
(from the name of Sabbatai Zevi), or, in abbreviated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
form, "Shebsen," continued as before. These Sabbatians
neglected many ceremonies, among them the fast of the Ninth
of Ab, which, because of its being the birthday of Sabbatai,
had been transformed by them from a day of mourning into a
festival. Their cult contained elements both of asceticism and
libertinism. While some gave themselves over to repentance,
self-torture, and mourning for Zion, others indulged in
debaucheries and excesses of all kinds. Alarmed by this dangerous
heresy, the rabbis at last resorted to energetic measures.
In the summer of 1722, a number of rabbis, coming from
various communities, assembled in Lemberg, and, with solemn
ceremonies, proclaimed the <i>herem</i> (excommunication) against
all Sabbatians who should fail to renounce their errors and
return to the path of Orthodoxy within a given time.</p>

<p>The measure was partly successful. Many sectarians
publicly confessed their sins, and submitted to severe penances.
In most cases, however, the "Shebsen" clung stubbornly to
their heresy, and in 1725 the rabbis were forced to launch a
second herem against them. By the new act of excommunication
every Orthodox Jew was called upon to report to the rabbinical
authorities all the secret sectarians known to him. The
act of excommunication was sent out to many communities, and
publicly recited in the synagogues. But even these persecutions
failed to wipe out the heresy. Secret Sabbatianism continued
to linger in the nooks and corners of Podolia and
Galicia, and finally degenerated into the dangerous movement
known as Frankism.</p>


<p>4. <span class="smcap">The Frankist Sect</span></p>

<p>Jacob Frank was born about 1726 in a town of Podolia. His
father Judah Leib belonged to the lower Jewish clergy, among
whom all kinds of perverted mystical notions were particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
in vogue. Judah Leib fell under suspicion as an adherent
of Sabbatianism, and was expelled from the community, which
he had served as rabbi or preacher. He settled in Wallachia,
where little Jacob grew up in an atmosphere filled with mystic
and Messianic fancies and marked by superstition and moral
laxity. From his early youth he showed repugnance to
study, and remained, as he later called himself, an ignoramus.
While living with his parents in Wallachia, he first
served as clerk in a shop, and afterwards became a traveling
salesman, peddling jewelry and notions through the towns
and villages. Occasionally young Jacob traveled with his
goods to adjoining Turkey, where he lived for some time in
Saloniki and Smyrna, the centers of the Sabbatian sect. Here,
it seems, Jacob received his nickname Frank, or Frenk, a designation
applied in the East to all Europeans. Between 1752
and 1755 he lived alternately in Smyrna and Saloniki, and
came in contact with the Sabbatians, participating in their
symbolic, semi-Mohammedan cult. It was then and there
that Jacob Frank was struck by the idea of returning to Poland
and playing the rôle of prophet and leader among the local
secret Sabbatians, who were oppressed and disorganized. It
was selfish ambition and the spirit of adventure rather than
mystical enthusiasm that pushed him in that direction.</p>

<p>In 1755 Frank made his appearance in Podolia and, joining
hands with the leaders of the local "Shebsen," began to
initiate them into the doctrines he had imported from Turkey.
The sectarians arranged secret meetings, at which the religious
mysteries centering around the Sabbatian "Trinity" (God,
the Messiah, and a female hypostasis of God, the <i>Shekhinah</i>)
were enunciated. Frank was evidently regarded as the second
person of the Trinity and as a reincarnation of Sabbatai Zevi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
being designated as S. S., <i>i. e.</i> Santo Senior,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> "the Holy Lord."
One of these assemblies ended in a scandal, and turned the
attention of the rabbis to this new agitation.</p>

<p>During the fair held in Lantzkorona,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Frank and two score
of his followers, consisting of men and women, had assembled
in an inn to hold their mystical services. They sang their
hymns, exciting themselves to the point of ecstasy by merrymaking
and dancing. Inquisitive outsiders managed to catch
a glimpse of the assembly, and afterwards related that the
sectarians danced around a nude woman, who may possibly
have represented the Shekhinah, or <i>Matronitha</i>,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> the third
person of the Trinity. The Orthodox Jews on the market-place,
who were not used to such orgies, were profoundly disgusted
by the conduct of the sectarians. They informed the
local Polish authorities that a Turkish subject was exciting
the people and propagating a new religion. The gay company
was arrested, Frank, being a foreigner, was banished to Turkey,
and his followers were delivered into the hands of the rabbis
and the Kahal authorities (1756).</p>

<p>A conference of rabbis was held in the town of Satanov,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and
scores of men and women, who had formerly belonged to the
Sabbatian sect, presented themselves to confess their sins and
to repent. The sectarians owned to having committed acts
which were subversive not only of the Jewish religion but also
of the fundamental principles of morality and chastity. The
women admitted that they had violated their conjugal fidelity,
and told of the sexual excesses in vogue among the sectarians,
which were justified by mystical speculations. On the basis of
all this evidence, the conference of rabbis in Brody, which
met during the sessions of the Council of the Four Lands, proclaimed
a strict herem against all heretics who had failed to
repent, and forbade all contact with them. They also prohibited
the study of the Zohar before the age of thirty and of
the Cabalistic writings of Ari,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> which were circulated during
that period in manuscript form, before the age of forty in
order to avoid the snares of mystical heterodoxy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then that the excommunicated and persecuted Podolian
sectarians, prompted by their leaders, resorted to a counsel
of despair. Their representatives appeared in the city of
Kamenetz-Podolsk before the Catholic Bishop Dembovski, and
declared that the Jewish sect of which they were members
rejected the Talmud as a false and harmful work, that they
only acknowledged the Zohar, the sacred book of the Cabala,
and believed that God was one in three persons, of whom the
Messianic Redeemer was one. This declaration aroused in
Bishop Dembovski the hope of converting the sectarians to
Christianity, notwithstanding the fact that by the "Messianic
Redeemer" they understood Sabbatai Zevi, or his reincarnation,
Jacob Frank. The Bishop ordered the publication of the
ambiguous confession of faith of the "Contra-Talmudists" or
"Zoharists"&mdash;as the sectarians designated themselves&mdash;and
decided to arrange a religious disputation between the Frankists
and the rabbis. The Podolian rabbis received strict orders
from the Bishop to send delegates from their midst to participate
in the proposed disputation. Their failure to appear
was to be punished by fines and the burning of the Talmud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>After considerable preparations, the disputation between the
leaders of the Contra-Talmudists and a number of rabbis took
place in Kamenetz, in the summer of 1757, in the presence of
Bishop Dembovski and representatives of the Catholic clergy.
The contest lasted seven days. The discussions centered
around certain peculiar utterances in the Talmudic Haggada,
which the Frankists cited as evidence of the "blasphemous"
character of the Talmud. The rabbis retorted feebly, hampered
by their inadequate mastery of the Polish language;
moreover, when the dispute turned on the fundamental dogmas
of Judaism, they refused to discuss them in the presence of
Catholic priests. The Bishop received the impression that the
Talmudists had been defeated. In the autumn of 1757 he
issued a rescript imposing a fine upon the Talmudists, to be
paid out to their opponents, for having insulted them at the
fair of Lantzkorona, and ordering that all Talmud copies
found in the diocese of Podolia be taken away from their
owners and delivered to the flames.</p>

<p>The revolting scenes of the time of Louis IX., of France, and
Pope Paul IV. were re-enacted. Thousands of Talmud copies
were taken away from the Jews and carried to Kamenetz, where
they were publicly burned on the market-place. The sectarians
witnessed their revenge on their persecutors and triumphed. It
is difficult to say how this triumph would have ended, had not
Bishop Dembovski suddenly died, in November, 1757. The sectarians
were deprived of their mainstay, and became again the
target of the Kahal authorities. In 1758 they finally succeeded
in obtaining a safe-conduct from King Augustus III., but even
this could not rescue them from the uncomfortable position
peculiar to those who, having forfeited the sympathies of their
own, have not yet been able to gain the confidence of strangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>At that critical juncture the sectarians decided to recall
Jacob Frank, their leader, from Turkey. The latter immediately
appeared in Podolia with a new plan, which, he hoped,
would at once rid him and his adherents of all opponents.
In the discourses delivered before his followers Frank dwelt
a great deal on his exalted mission and on the divine revelations
which commanded him to follow in the footsteps of
Sabbatai Zevi. Just as Sabbatai had been compelled to embrace
the Mohammedan faith temporarily, so he and his
adherents were predestined from above to adopt the Christian
religion as a mere disguise and as a stepping-stone to the "faith
of the true Messiah." Filled with thirst for revenge, the
sectarians hit upon the fiendish thought of lending the weight
of their testimony to the hideous ritual murder accusation,
which was agitating the whole of Poland at that time, claiming
many a victim in the Jewish ranks.</p>

<p>In 1759 the Frankists were busily engaged in negotiations
with the highest representatives of the Polish Church concerning
their proposed conversion to Christianity. They requested
at the same time that they be allowed to hold a public disputation
with the rabbis, whom they hoped to expose before
the non-Jews. The Primate of the Polish Church Lubinski
and the Papal Nuncio Serra received the advances of the Frankists
with considerable skepticism. But the temporary administrator
of the diocese of Lemberg, Canon Mikolski, insisted that
their request be complied with. A second religious disputation
between the Talmudists and the Frankists, presided over
by Mikolski, was held in Lemberg, and took up eleven sessions
(July-August, 1759). At this disputation the Orthodox Jews
were represented by a number of Talmudists, headed by the
Rabbi of Lemberg, Hayyim Rapoport, while the cause of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
sectarians was championed by Solomon Shorr and Leib Krysa,
the principal associates of Frank, as well as several learned
Catholic theologians.</p>

<p>The sectarians advanced seven theses as a basis for discussion.
Six dealt with the Messianic belief and the dogma
of the Trinity, the latter having been practically adopted by
them in its Christian formulation. The seventh asserted that
"the Talmud considers the use of Christian blood obligatory."
The discussion about the first six clauses was rather tame and
conventional, largely owing to the fact that the rabbis, who
were afraid of offending the religious susceptibilities of the
Christians, declined in many cases to state their views. Only
when it came to the last point, the malicious accusation of
ritual murder, were the rabbis energetic in refuting it, protesting
vehemently against the Frankists, who openly appeared as
the enemies of their people.</p>

<p>When the disputation was over, the sectarians were called
upon to prove their devotion to Christianity by immediate
action. The conversion of the Frankists began. The baptismal
ceremony was performed with great solemnity in the
churches of Lemberg, members of the Polish nobility acting
as sponsors. The neophytes assumed the family names and
titles of their godfathers, and in this way received admission
into the ranks of the Polish nobility. In Lemberg alone 514
men and women, among them Leib Krysa, Solomon Shorr, and
the other fellow-workers of Frank, were converted in the
course of 1759 and 1760. Frank entered Lemberg with great
pomp, riding in a carriage drawn by six horses and surrounded
by a large body-guard. Here he submitted to a preliminary
baptism, desiring to complete the ceremony with greater
solemnity in Warsaw. Having arrived in the Polish capital,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Frank petitioned King Augustus III. to act as his godfather.
The King consented, and the conversion of the sectarian chief
to Catholicism took place in November, 1759, with extraordinary
splendor, in the presence of the royal family and the
court dignitaries. At his baptism Jacob Frank assumed the
name Joseph.</p>

<p>However, the attitude of the Polish clergy towards the
newly-converted sectarians remained as skeptical as theretofore.
Frank's obscure past, his strange manner of living, the reverence
accorded to him by his followers, who styled him the
"Holy Lord"&mdash;all this was bound to arouse the suspicion of
the ecclesiastic authorities. The indiscretion of some Frankists,
or perhaps a secret denunciation, confirmed the clergy in
their suspicions. They learned that the conversion of the sectarians
had been an act of hypocrisy, that Frank continued to
pose among them as Messiah and "Holy Lord," and that the
Trinity professed by them had very little in common with the
corresponding Christian dogma. They decided to investigate
the matter, and, in case their suspicion should prove true, to
indict the leaders of the sect before the ecclesiastic courts.</p>

<p>In January, 1760, Frank was arrested in Warsaw by order of
the highest Church authorities, and subjected to a searching
cross-examination. With all his astuteness, the chief of the
Frankists failed to convince the judges of his Christian Orthodoxy.
Many of the depositions made by his disciples or by
himself only strengthened the case against him. The ecclesiastic
court, having previously ascertained the attitude of Rome
through the Papal Nuncio, sentenced Frank to imprisonment
in the citadel of Chenstokhov and to detention in the local
monastery, so as to prevent all contact with his followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirteen years (1760-1772) Frank remained in the citadel,
but the Catholic clergy failed in its purpose. The Frankists
continued their relations with the "Holy Lord," who as a
suffering Messiah was now surrounded in their eyes with a new
halo. They even managed to penetrate into Chenstokhov
itself, and settled in large numbers on the outskirts of the
town, which, in accordance with old Messianic notions, they
designated as "the gates of Rome."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> They beheld in Frank's
fate a repetition of the destiny of Sabbatai Zevi, who had been
equally kept prisoner in the castle of Abydos, near the capital
of Turkey. They were inspired by Frank's mystical discourses
and epistles, the gist of which was that their only salvation lay
in the "holy religion of Edom," a term by which he understood
a strange medley of Christian and Sabbatian ideas. The new
religion was devoid of any truly religious or moral element, and
the same applies to the life of Frank, who cynically expressed
himself to his followers: "I have come to rid the world of all
the laws and statutes which have been in existence hitherto."
There was nothing reminding one of an apostle about the conduct
of the "Holy Lord," based as it was on mystification
and on the endeavor to accommodate oneself to the environment.</p>

<p>The first partition of Poland put an end to Frank's imprisonment
in the monastery. He was released by the commander
of the Russian troops which occupied Chenstokhov towards the
end of 1772. After a brief stay in Warsaw, where he managed
to re-establish direct relations with the sectarians, Frank,
accompanied by his family and a large retinue, left the boundaries
of Poland and settled in Brünn, in Moravia (1773).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>The further exploits of this adventurer were performed in a
new field, in Western Europe. In Catholic Austria, Frank
assumed the rôle of a Christian missionary among the Jews,
and even succeeded in gaining the favor of the Court in Vienna.
However, his past soon became known, and he had to leave
Austria. Frank settled in Germany, in Offenbach, near Frankfort-on-the-Main,
where he arrogated to himself the title of
"Baron of Offenbach." In his new place of residence, Frank,
assisted by his daughter Eve, or the "Holy Lady," stood at the
head of a secret circle of sectarians, and, supported by his
Polish and Moravian partisans, led a life of ease and luxury.</p>

<p>After the death of Frank, which occurred in 1791, his sect
began to disintegrate, and the flow of gifts for the benefit of
the Offenbach Society gradually ceased. After unsuccessful
endeavors to attract sectarians, Frank's successor, Eve, found
herself entangled in debts, and, pursued by her creditors, died
in 1816 in Offenbach. The Frankists who had stayed in
Poland, though outwardly Catholics, remained loyal to the
"Holy Lord" down to the day of his death. For a long time
they intermarried among themselves, and were known in
Poland under the name of "Neophytes." But by and by they
were merged with the Catholic population, gradually losing
the character of a sect, and were at last completely absorbed by
their Polish environment.</p>


<p>5. <span class="smcap">The Rise of Hasidism and Israel Baal-Shem-Tob</span></p>

<p>Frankism proved the grave of Sabbatianism, by turning its
dreamy mysticism into mystification, and its lofty Messianism
into the selfish desire to escape Jewish suffering through disloyalty
to Judaism. It was a grossly negative, materialistic
movement, which disregarded the noblest strivings and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
most genuine longings of the Jewish soul. The need for a
deepened religious consciousness, which the formalities of
Rabbinism had failed to satisfy, remained as alive as ever
among the Jewish masses. This need was bound to give rise
to a positive religious movement, which was in harmony with
the traditional ideas of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>In the spiritual life of Polish Jewry the distinction between
its two ethnographic groups, the northwestern, the Lithuanian
and White Russian, and the southwestern, the Polish
and Ukrainian, became more and more accentuated. In the
northwest rabbinic scholasticism reigned supreme, and the
caste of scholars, petrified in the ideas of Talmudic Babylonia,
was the determining factor in public life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Talmudic scholarship&mdash;remarks a contemporary Lithuanian
Jew, the subsequently famous philosopher Solomon Maimon&mdash;constitutes
the principal object of education among us. Wealth,
physical attractions, or endowments of any kind, though appreciated
by the people, do not, in its estimation, compare with the
dignity of a good Talmudist. The Talmudist has the first claim
on all offices and honorary posts in the community. Whenever he
appears at an assembly, all rise before him, and conduct him to the
foremost place. He is the confidant, the counselor, the legislator,
and the judge of the plain man.</p></div>

<p>Matters, however, were different in Podolia, Galicia, Volhynia,
and in the whole southwestern region in general. Here
the Jewish masses were much further removed from the
sources of rabbinic learning, having emancipated themselves
from the influence of the Talmudic scholar. While in Lithuania
dry book-learning was inseparable from a godly life, in
Podolia and Volhynia it failed to satisfy the religious cravings
of the common man. The latter was in need of beliefs
easier of understanding and making an appeal to the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
rather than to the mind. He found these beliefs in the
Cabala, in mystic and Messianic doctrines, in Sabbatianism.
He even let himself be carried away by teachings which ultimately
proved heterodox and subversive of the spirit of
Judaism. With the downfall of secret Sabbatianism, which
had been utterly compromised by the Frankists, disappeared
the last will-o'-the-wisp of Messianism, which had beckoned
to the groping Jewish masses. It was necessary to fill the
mental void thus created, and provide new food for the unsatisfied
religious longings. This task was undertaken by
the new <i>Hasidism</i> ("Doctrine of Piety"), originated by
Besht, a product of obscure Podolian Jewry.</p>

<p>Israel Baal-Shem-Tob (in abbreviated form BeSHT) was
born about 1700 on the border line of Podolia and Wallachia of
a poor Jewish family. Having lost his parents at an early age,
he was cared for by some charitable townsmen of his, who sent
him to a Jewish school, or heder, to study the Talmud. The
heder-learning did not attract the boy, endowed as he was
with an impressionable and dreamy disposition. Israel frequently
played the truant, and was more than once discovered
in the neighboring forest lost in thought. The boy was finally
given up as a bad case, and expelled from school. At the age
of twelve, Israel, confronted by the necessity of earning a
livelihood, became a <i>behelfer</i>, an assistant teacher, and, a
little later, obtained the post of a synagogue beadle. In his
new dignity, Besht conducted himself rather oddly. In daytime
he slept, or pretended to sleep, but at night, when all
alone in the synagogue, he prayed fervently, or read soul-saving
books. Those around him looked upon him as an eccentric
or maniac. He nevertheless persisted in his course. He
delved more and more deeply in the mysteries of the Practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Cabala, studied the "Ari manuscripts," which were
circulated from hand to hand, and acquainted himself with the
art of performing miracles by means of Cabalistic incantations.</p>

<p>When about twenty years of age, Israel settled in Brody,
one of the principal cities of Galicia, and married the sister
of the well-known rabbi and Cabalist of the town, Gershon
Kutover. Kutover at first tried to interest his brother-in-law
in the study of the Talmud, but, finding him entirely
indifferent to this kind of mental occupation, the proud rabbi,
abashed by his relationship with such an ignoramus, advised
Israel to leave Brody. Besht followed the advice, and removed
with his wife to a village between the towns of Kuty and Kosovo.
He frequently retired to the neighboring Carpathian mountains,
where in strict solitude he fasted, prayed, and lost
himself in religious speculation. He eked out an existence for
himself and his wife by digging clay in the mountains, which
his wife carried into the city for sale. According to the Hasidic
legend, Israel Besht led this kind of life for seven years. It
was a period of preparation for his subsequent calling. At
the end of his mystical exploits in the Carpathian mountains,
Besht lived in the Galician town of Tlusta, where he occupied
minor ecclesiastic positions, acting in succession as melammed,
shohet, and cantor of a synagogue. He was universally
regarded as an ignoramus, no one being aware of his innermost
cravings.</p>

<p>At last, after reaching the age of thirty-six, Besht decided,&mdash;by
inspiration from above, as the Hasidim believe,&mdash;that the
time had come "to reveal himself to the world." He began
to practice as a <i>Baal-Shem</i>,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> <i>i. e.</i> as a magician and Cabalist
and to cure diseases by means of secret incantations, amulets
(<i>kameoth</i>), and medicinal herbs. The figure of a wandering
Baal-Shem was not unusual among the Polish Jews of the
time, and Besht chose this career, for it subsequently proved
a convenient medium for his religious propaganda. He traveled
about the towns and villages of Volhynia and Podolia,
curing with his herbs and incantations not only Jews, but also
peasants and even pans, who had great faith in magic remedies.
He won the reputation of a miracle-worker, and was nicknamed
the "good Baal-Shem" (in Hebrew, <i>Baal-Shem-Tob</i>). The
Jewish masses felt that he was not the ordinary type of conjurer,
but a man of righteousness and saintliness. Besht was
frequently called upon to foretell the future, and, opening at
random the Zohar before him, made predictions as suggested
by the holy book. In curing the sick, he resorted not only to
herbs and incantations, but also to prayer. While praying, he
often fell into ecstasy and gesticulated violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>Besht became the favorite of the masses. Warm-hearted
and simple in disposition, he managed to get close to the
people and find out their spiritual wants. Originally a healer
of the body, he imperceptibly grew to be a teacher of religion.
He taught that true salvation lies not in Talmudic learning,
but in whole-hearted devotion to God, in unsophisticated faith
and fervent prayer. When he encountered men of learning,
Besht endeavored to convince them of the correctness of his
views by arguments from the Cabala. But he did not recognize
that ascetic form of Cabala which enjoined upon the Jew
to foster a mournful frame of mind, to kill the flesh, and strive
after the expiation of sin in order to accelerate the coming of
the Messiah. He rather had in mind that Cabala which seeks
to establish an intimate communion between man and God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
cheering the human soul by the belief in the goodness of God,
encouraging and comforting the poor, the persecuted, and the
suffering. Besht preached that the plain man, imbued with
naïve faith, and able to pray fervently and whole-heartedly,
was dearer and nearer to God than the learned formalist spending
his whole life in the study of the Talmud. Not to speculate
in religious matters, but to believe blindly and devotedly, such
was the motto of Besht. This simplified formula of Judaism
appealed to the Jewish masses and to those democratically
inclined scholars who were satisfied neither with rabbinic
scholasticism nor with the ascetic Cabala of the school of Ari.</p>

<p>About 1740 Besht chose for his permanent residence the
small Podolian town of Medzhibozh. The rôle of sorcerer
and miracle-worker gradually moved to the background, and
Besht emerged as a full-fledged teacher of religion. He
placed himself at the head of his large circle of disciples and
followers, who were initiated by him into the mysteries of the
new doctrine, not by way of systematic exposition, but rather
in the form of sayings and parables. These sayings have been
preserved by his nearest disciples, Besht himself having left
nothing in writing.</p>

<p>Two ideas lie at the bottom of the "Doctrine of Piety," or
the Hasidism, of Besht: the idea of Pantheism, of the Omnipresence
of God, and the idea of the interaction of the
lower and upper worlds. The former may be approximately
defined by the following utterances of Besht:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is necessary for man constantly to bear in mind that God is
with him always and everywhere; that He is, so to speak, the
finest kind of matter, which is poured out everywhere; that He is
the master of all that happens in the Universe.... Let man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>realize that when he looks at things material he beholds in
reality the Divine Countenance, which is present everywhere.
Keeping this in mind, man will find it possible to serve the Lord
at all times, even in trifles.</p></div>

<p>The second fundamental idea is borrowed from the Cabala,
and signifies that there is a constant interaction between the
world of the Divine and the human world, so that not only
does the Deity influence human actions, but the latter exert a
similar influence on the will and the disposition of the Deity.</p>

<p>The further elements of the Besht doctrine follow logically
from these premises. <i>Communion with God</i> is and must be
the principal endeavor of every truly religious man. This
communion may be attained by concentrating one's thoughts
upon God, and attributing to Him all happenings in life. The
essence of faith lies in the emotions, not in the intellect; the
more profound the emotions, the nearer man is to God. <i>Prayer</i>
is the most important medium through which man can
attain communion with God. To render this communion perfect,
prayer must be ecstatic and fervent, so that he who prays
may, as it were, throw off his material film. To attain to this
ecstatic condition, recourse may be had to mechanical contrivances,
such as violent motions of the body, shouts, shaking,
and so on. The study of Jewish religious legislation is of
secondary importance, and is useful only when it succeeds in
arousing an exalted religious disposition. From this point
of view the reading of ethical books is preferable to the study
of Talmudic casuistry and rabbinical folios.</p>

<p>Contrary to the fundamental precept of the Practical Cabala,
Besht insists that excessive fasting, the killing of the flesh,
and ascetic exercises in general, are injurious and sinful, and
that a lively and cheerful disposition is more acceptable to God.
What is most important in religion is the frame of mind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
not the external ceremonies: <i>excessive minuteness of religious
observance is harmful</i>. The pious, or <i>Hasid</i>, should serve God
not only by observing the established ceremonies, but also in
his everyday affairs and even in his thoughts. By means of
constant spiritual communion with God, man may attain to
the gift of clairvoyance, prophecy, and miracle-working. The
Righteous, or <i>Tzaddik</i>, is he who lives up to the precepts of
Hasidism in the highest measure attainable, and is on account
of it nearer and dearer to God than any one else. The
function of the Tzaddik is <i>to serve as mediator between God
and the common people</i>. The Tzaddik enables man to attain
to perfect purity of soul and to every earthly and heavenly
blessing. The Tzaddik ought to be revered and looked up to
as God's messenger and favorite.</p>

<p>In this way the doctrine preached by Besht undermined not
only scholastic and ceremonial Rabbinism, but also the ascetic
Cabala, emphasizing in their stead the principle of blind faith
in Providence, of fervent and inspiring prayer, and, last but
not least, the dogma of attaining salvation through the
medium of the miracle-working Tzaddik. The last-mentioned
article of faith was of immense consequence for the
further development of Hasidism, and subsequently overshadowed
the cardinal principles of the new movement.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the personality of Besht as the first
Tzaddik impressed the people far more than his doctrine,
which could be fully grasped only by his nearest associates
and disciples. Among these the following were particularly
prominent: Jacob Joseph Cohen, who occupied the post of
rabbi successively in Shargorod, Niemirov, and Polonnoye;
Baer of Mezherich, a Volhynian preacher and Cabalist; Nahman
of Horodno, Nahman of Kosovo, Phineas of Koretz, all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
whom frequently visited Besht in Medzhibozh. Even the
former Rabbi of Brody, Gershon Kutover, who had once
looked down on his brother-in-law as an <i>Am ha-Aretz</i>,
acknowledged his religious mission.</p>

<p>About 1750, Besht sent to his brother-in-law Kutover,
who had in the meantime settled in the Holy Land, a kind of
prophetic manifesto, telling of his miraculous vision, or <i>revelation</i>.
In it Besht asserted that on the day of the Jewish New
Year his soul had been lifted up to heaven, where he beheld the
Messiah and many souls of the dead. In reply to the petition
of Besht, "Let me know, my Master, when thou wilt appear
on earth," the Messiah said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This shall be a sign unto thee: when thy doctrine shall become
known, and the fountains of thy wisdom shall be poured forth,
when all other men shall have the power of performing the same
mysteries as thyself, then shall disappear all the hosts of impurity,
and the time of great favor and salvation shall arrive.</p></div>

<p>Revelations of this kind were greatly in vogue at the time,
and had a profound effect upon mystically inclined minds.
The notion spread that Besht was in contact with the prophet
Elijah, and that his "teacher" was the Biblical seer Ahijah
of Shilo. As far as the common people are concerned, they believed
in Besht as a miracle-worker, and loved him as a religious
teacher who made no distinction between the educated
and the ordinary Jew. The scholars and Cabalists
were fascinated by his wise discourses and parables, in which
the most abstract tenets of the Cabala were concretely
illustrated, reduced to popular language, and applied to the
experiences of everyday life. Besht's circle in Medzhibozh
grew constantly in number. Shortly before his death, Besht
witnessed the agitation conducted by the Frankists in Podolia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and their subsequent wholesale baptism. The Polish rabbis
rejoiced in the conversion of the sectarians to Catholicism,
since it rid the Jewish people of dangerous heretics. But
when Besht learned of the fact, he exclaimed: "I heard the
Lord cry and say: As long as the diseased limb is joined to the
body, there is hope that it may be cured in time; but when it
has been cut off, it is lost forever." There is reason to believe
that Besht was one of the rabbis who had been invited to
participate in the Frankist disputation in Lemberg, in 1759.
In the spring of the following year, Besht breathed his last,
surrounded by his disciples.</p>


<p>6. <span class="smcap">The Hasidic Propaganda and the Growth of
Tzaddikism</span></p>

<p>At the time of Besht's death, his doctrine had gained a
considerable number of adherents in Podolia, Galicia, and
Volhynia, who assumed the name Hasidim. But the systematic
propaganda of Hasidism began only after the death of Besht,
and was carried on by his successors and apostles. His first
successor was the preacher Baer of Mezherich, referred to previously,
under whom the little town of Mezherich became the
headquarters of Hasidism in Volhynia, just as Medzhibozh
had been in Podolia. In point of originality and depth of
sentiment Baer was vastly inferior to his master, but he surpassed
him in erudition. His scholarship insured the success
of the Hasidic propaganda among the learned class, and also
enabled him to become one of the main exponents of the
theory of Hasidism.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> In the course of twelve years (1760-1772)
Baer managed to surround himself with a large number
of prominent Talmudists, who had become enthusiastic converts
to Hasidism; some of them came from arch-rabbinical
Lithuania and White Russia. Baer developed the doctrine of
Besht, laying particular stress upon the principle of Tzaddikism.
He trained a staff of apostles, who eventually became
the founders of Tzaddik dynasties in various parts of Poland
and Lithuania. Tzaddikism served as a bait for the common
people, who, instead of a rational belief in certain religious
truths, preferred to put their blind faith in the human exponents
of these truths&mdash;in the Tzaddiks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>The same tendency characterized the activity of another
apostle of Besht, Jacob Joseph Cohen, who paid for his devotion
to Hasidism by having to endure the persecutions of his
rabbinical colleagues. Having lost the post of rabbi in Shargorod,
Cohen, with the aid of Besht, accepted the position of
preacher in Niemirov, and, after the death of his master,
acted as preacher in Polonnoye. Everywhere he was zealously
engaged in propagating the Hasidic doctrine by means of the
spoken and written word. Jacob Joseph Cohen was the first to
attempt a literary exposition of the fundamental principles of
Hasidism. In 1780 he published a collection of sermons,
under the title <i>Toldoth Ya`kob Yoseph</i>,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> reproducing numerous
sayings which he had heard from the lips of Besht. While
exalting the importance of the Tzaddiks, who were solicitous
about the salvation of the common people, Jacob Joseph bitterly
assails the arrogant Talmudists, or "pseudo-scholars,"
whose whole religion is limited to book-learning, and whose
attitude towards the masses is one of contempt. Jacob Joseph's
book laid the foundation of Hasidic literature, which differs
both in content and form not only from rabbinical but also
from the earlier Cabalistic literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>In the last decades of the eighteenth century, Hasidism
spread with incredible rapidity among the Jewish masses of
Poland and partly even of Lithuania. Numerous communities
saw the rise of Hasidic congregations and the establishment of
separate houses of prayer, in which services, characterized by
boundless ecstasy, violent shouts, and gestures, were held in
accordance with Besht's prescriptions. The Hasidim adopted
the Cabalistic prayer-book of Ari, which differed from the accepted
liturgy by numerous textual alterations and transpositions.
They neglected the traditional time limit for morning
prayers, changed the ritual of slaughtering animals, and some
of them were in the habit of dressing themselves in white on the
Sabbath. They were fond of whiling away their time in noisy
assemblies, and frequently indulged in merry drinking bouts,
to foster, in accordance with Besht's precept, "a cheerful disposition."</p>

<p>The most characteristic trait of the Hasidim, however, was
their boundless veneration of the "holy" Tzaddiks. Though
logically the outcome of Hasidism, in practice Tzaddikism
was in many cases its forerunner. The appearance of some
miracle-working Tzaddik in a certain neighborhood frequently
resulted in wholesale conversions to Hasidism. The Tzaddik's
home was overrun by crowds of men and women who in their
credulity hoped to obtain a cure for diseases or a remedy for
the sterility of their women, or who asked for a blessing, for
predictions of the future, or sought advice in practical matters.
If, in one case out of many, the Tzaddik succeeded in helping
one of his clients, or if one of his guesses or predictions proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to be correct, his fame as a miracle-worker was firmly established,
and the population of the neighborhood was sure to be
won over to Hasidism.</p>

<p>The number of Hasidic partisans grew in proportion to the
number of Tzaddiks, of whom there were a great many in the
last two decades of the eighteenth century. The most authoritative
Tzaddiks came from the circle of Baer of Mezherich.
Every one of them either laid his own individual impress upon
the doctrine preached by him, or endeavored to adapt himself
to the habits of the population of his district. As a result, the
Hasidic doctrine branched out rapidly, falling into different
varieties. The principal branches of Hasidism were two: that
of Poland and Ukraina, and that of Lithuania and White
Russia.</p>

<p>The former was represented by Elimelech of Lizno, in
Galicia, Levi Itzhok of Berdychev, Nohum of Chernobyl, and
Borukh of Tulchyn, a grandson of Besht. Elimelech of Lizno,
who died in 1786, carried the doctrine of practical Tzaddikism
to its radical conclusions. He preached that the first duty
of the Hasid consists in reverence for the Tzaddik. The
Tzaddik is "a middleman between Israel and God." Through
his intercession God bestows upon the faithful all earthly
blessings&mdash;"life, children, and sustenance"<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>; if the Tzaddik
wills otherwise, the flow of blessings is stopped. The Hasid is
therefore obliged to have blind faith in the Tzaddik, to look
upon him as his benefactor, and to give him of his means. The
Tzaddik should be supported by donations in cash and in kind,
so that he may devote himself wholly to the service of God and
thereby prove a blessing to mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>This commercial theory of an exchange of services accomplished
its purpose. The people brought their last pennies
to the Tzaddik, and the Tzaddik in turn was indefatigable
in bestowing blessings, pouring forth divine favors upon earth,
healing the cripples, curing the sterility of women, and so on.
The profitable calling of Tzaddik became hereditary, passing
from father to son and grandson. Everywhere petty "dynasties"
of Tzaddiks sprang up, which multiplied rapidly and
endeavored to wrest the supremacy from one another. Such
was the fate of the cult of the Righteous taught by Besht,
which now assumed gross materialistic forms.</p>

<p>It is fair to add, however, that not everywhere did Tzaddikism
sink to such low depths. There were Tzaddiks who were
idealists, lovers of mankind, and saintly men, however strange
the forms in which these virtues often manifested themselves.
One of these men, to quote one instance, was Levi Itzhok of
Berdychev, who in his youth had been cruelly persecuted by
the Lithuanian rabbis for his devotion to Hasidism. Towards
the end of the eighteenth century he settled in Berdychev as
Tzaddik, and became tremendously popular in his new calling
on account of his saintly life and his fatherly love for the common
people. Speaking generally, however, the Ukrainian,
Podolian, and Galician Tzaddiks had one tendency in common,
that of inculcating in their followers a blind faith in the truths
of Hasidism and shunning all "speculation" as injurious to
religious sentiment.</p>

<p>The development of Hasidism in Lithuania and White Russia
was altogether different. Whereas in the south Hasidism
captured entire communities at one stroke, meeting with feeble
resistance from the dry-as-dust representatives of Rabbinism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in the north it was forced to engage in a bitter struggle for
existence with powerful Rabbinism as represented by the Kahal
organization. At the same time it received a special coloring
there. The Hasidism of Besht, having been carried to the
north by the disciples of Baer of Mezherich, Aaron of Karlin,
Mendel of Vitebsk, and Zalman of Ladi, could not help
absorbing many elements of the dominant doctrine of Rabbinism.
The principal exponent of this new teaching in the
North, Zalman Shneorsohn<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> (died 1813), of Lozno, and later
of Ladi, both in the Government of Moghilev, succeeded in
creating a remarkable system of thought, which may well be
designated as "rational Hasidism." He summed up his
theory in the words: "Wisdom, Understanding, and Knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>While in the main adopting the doctrine of Besht, Zalman
injected into it the method of religious and philosophic investigation.
"Speculation" in matters of faith&mdash;within certain
limits, of course&mdash;was, in his opinion, not only permissible
but even obligatory. He demanded that the Tzaddik be,
not a miracle-worker, but a religious teacher. He purged
Hasidism of numerous vulgar superstitions, robbing it at the
same time of the childlike <i>naïveté</i> which characterized the
original doctrine of Besht. Zalman's own theory was adapted
to the comparatively high intellectual level of the Jewish population
of the Northwest. In the South it was never able to
gain adherents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span><span class="smcap">7. Rabbinism, Hasidism, and the Forerunners of
Enlightenment</span></p>

<p>Rabbinism had long been scenting a dangerous enemy in
Hasidism. The principle proclaimed by Besht, that man is
saved by faith and not by religious knowledge, was in violent
contradiction with the fundamental dogma of Rabbinism,
which measured the religious worth of a man by the extent
of his Talmudic learning. The rabbi looked upon the Tzaddik
as a dangerous rival, as a new type of popular priest, who,
feeding on the superstition of the masses, rapidly gained
their confidence. The lower Jewish classes abandoned the
uninspiring Talmudist, whose subtleties they failed to comprehend,
and flocked to the miracle-working Tzaddik, who offered
them, not only his practical advice, but also his blessing, thus
saving soul and body at one and the same time. However,
completely defeated by Hasidism in the South, Rabbinism still
reigned supreme in the North, and finally declared a war of
extermination against its rival.</p>

<p>During the period under discussion, in the latter part of the
eighteenth century, the leader of the Lithuanian rabbis was
Elijah of Vilna (1720-1797), who received the ancient, high-sounding
title of Gaon.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> He was the incarnation of that
power of intellect which was the product of subtle Talmudic
reasoning. Early in his childhood Elijah displayed phenomenal
ability. At the age of six he managed to read the Talmudic
text without the aid of a teacher. At the age of ten he
participated in difficult Talmudic discussions, amazing old
rabbis by his erudition. His mind rapidly absorbed everything
that came within its range. Elijah was familiar with the
Cabala, and incidentally picked up enough of mathematics,
astronomy, and physics, to be able to follow certain discussions
in the Talmud. He lived in Vilna as a recluse, leading the life
of an ascete and burying himself entirely in his books. He took
little nourishment, slept two hours a day, rarely conversed
about secular affairs, his contact with the outside world being
practically limited to the Talmudic lectures which he delivered
before his pupils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>Elijah avoided the method of pilpul, which was meant to
exercise the mind by inventing artificial contradictions in the
Talmudic text and subsequently removing them. Knowing
by heart almost the entire Talmudic and rabbinic literature,
he had no difficulty in solving the most complicated questions
of Jewish law, and, guided by subtle critical observations,
occasionally allowed himself to emend the text of the Talmud.
Elijah Gaon wrote commentaries and all sorts of
"annotations" to Biblical, Talmudic, and Cabalistic books,
but his style was, as a rule, careless, consisting of hints, references,
and abbreviations, intelligible only to the learned reader.
In his spare moments he occasionally wrote about Hebrew grammar
and mathematical sciences. Rabbinical learning was his
native element, embodying for him the whole meaning of
religion. In questions of religious ceremonialism he was a
rigorist, adding here and there new restrictions to the multifarious
injunctions of the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>. He was the idol
of all the learned rabbis of Lithuania and other countries,
but the masses understood him as little as he understood them.
A spiritual aristocrat, he was bound to condemn severely the
"plebeian" doctrine of Hasidism. The latter offended in
him equally the learned Talmudist, the rigorous ascete, and
the strict guardian of ceremonial Judaism, of which certain
minutiae had been modified by the Hasidim after their
own fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>As far back as 1772, when the first Hasidic societies were
secretly organized in Lithuania, and several of their leaders
were discovered in Vilna, the rabbinical Kahal court of that
city pronounced, with the permission of Elijah Gaon, the
herem against the sectarians. From Vilna circulars were sent
out to the rabbis of other communities, calling upon them to
wage war against the "godless sect." In many towns of
Lithuania the Hasidim became the object of persecution. The
rabbis of Galicia, having been forewarned from Vilna, followed
suit, and at a meeting held in Brody, during the local
fair, issued a most rigorous herem against every Jew following
the Hasidic liturgy, dressing in white on Saturdays and
holidays,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and in general participating in the conventicles of
the Hasidim.</p>

<p>We have already had occasion<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> to refer to the work of the
Hasidic apostle Jacob Joseph Cohen (<i>Toldoth Ya`kob Yoseph</i>),
which for the first time reproduced the sayings of Besht, and,
by way of comment, indulged in attacks upon the scholastic
"pseudo-wisdom" of the rabbis. Cohen's work, which appeared
in 1780, once more stirred the rabbinical world. From Vilna
the signal was given for a new campaign against the Hasidim.
The rabbis of Lithuania, assembling in 1781 at the fair of
Zelva, in the Government of Grodno, issued appeals to all
Jewish communities, demanding the severest possible penalties
for "the dishonorable followers of Besht, the destroyer
of Israel." All orthodox Jews were called upon to ostracize the
Hasidim socially, to regard them as infidels, to shun all contact
and avoid intermarriage with them, and to refrain from
burying their dead. The opponents of the Hasidim called
themselves <i>Mithnagdim</i>, "Protestants," and persecuted them
everywhere as dangerous schismatics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The formation of important Hasidic societies in White
Russia, under the leadership of Zalman Shneorsohn, increased
the agitation of the Mithnagdim. At the rabbinical conferences
held in Moghilev and Shklov severe measures were
adopted against the Hasidim, and their leader was proclaimed
a heretic. In vain did Zalman defend himself, and, in his
epistles to the rabbis, demonstrate his Orthodoxy. In vain did
he travel to Vilna to obtain a personal interview with Elijah
Gaon and remove the stain of heresy from himself and his followers.
The stern Gaon refused even to see the exponent of
heterodoxy. At the very end of the eighteenth century the
strife of parties in Russian Jewry became more and more
accentuated, and finally led, as we shall see later,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> to the interference
of the Russian Government.</p>

<p>While warring with one another, Rabbinism and Hasidism
found a point of contact in their common hatred of the new
Enlightenment, which proceeded from the Mendelssohn circle
in Berlin. If Rabbinism opposed secular knowledge actively,
looking upon it as a competitor who contested its own spiritual
monopoly, Hasidism opposed it passively, with its whole being,
prompted by an irresistible leaning towards mental drowsiness
and "pious fraud." Hasidism and its inseparable companion
Tzaddikism, the products of a mystical outlook on life,
were powerless against cold logical reasoning. It stands to
reason that the Tzaddiks were even more hostile towards
secular learning than the rabbis. True, Rabbinism had immersed
the Jewish mind in the stagnant waters of scholasticism,
but Hasidism, in its further development, endeavored
altogether to lull rational thinking to sleep, and to cultivate,
to an excessive degree, the religious imagination at its expense.
The new cultural movement which had arisen among the Jews
of Germany had no chance of penetrating into this dark realm,
which was guarded on the one hand by scholasticism and on
the other by mysticism. The few isolated individuals in Polish
Jewry who manifested a leaning towards secular culture were
forced to go abroad, primarily to Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>One of these rare fugitives from the realm of darkness was
Solomon Maimon (1754-1800). He was born the son of a
village arendar in Lithuania, near Nesvizh, in the Government
of Minsk, where he received a Talmudic education, and
where, having scarcely reached the age of twelve, he was married
off by his old-fashioned parents. However, unlike thousands
of other Jewish lads, he managed to escape spiritual death
in the mire of everyday life. Endowed with a searching mind,
Solomon Maimon was driven constantly onward in his mental
development. From the Talmud he passed to the Cabala, in
which at one time he was completely absorbed. From the
Cabala he made a sudden leap to the religious philosophy of
Maimonides and other medieval Jewish rationalists. His
youthful intellect was eager for new impressions, and these his
immediate surroundings failed to give him. In 1777 Maimon
left home and family, and went to Germany to acquire secular
culture. He found himself first in Königsberg, and then proceeded
to Berlin, Posen, Hamburg, and Breslau, enduring all
kinds of suffering, and tasting to the full the bitterness of a
wanderer's life in a strange land. In Berlin he came in contact
with Mendelssohn and his circle, rapidly acquired a knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of German literature and science, and made a deep study of
philosophy, particularly of the system of Kant.</p>

<p>The sudden transition from rabbinic scholasticism to the
"Critical Philosophy" of Germany, and from the primitive
existence of a Lithuanian Jew to the free life of an educated
European, destroyed Maimon's mental equilibrium. He fell a
prey to skepticism and unbelief, denying the foundations of all
religion and morality, and led a disorderly life, which made
his best friends turn from him. In his philosophic criticism,
Maimon went much further than Kant. In 1790 he published
in German "A Tentative Investigation of Transcendental
Philosophy," and this book was followed by a number of
writings dealing with metaphysics and logic. Kant, on reading
his first book, made the remark: "No one among my
opponents has grasped the essence of my system as profoundly
as Maimon, nor are there altogether many men endowed
with so refined and penetrating a mind in questions so
abstract and complex." In 1792 Solomon Maimon published
his "Autobiography" (<i>Lebensgeschichte</i>), a remarkable book,
in which he vividly describes the conditions of life and the
ideas prevalent among Polish Lithuanian Jews as well as his
own sad Odyssey. The Autobiography made a profound impression
upon educated Christians, among others on Goethe
and Schiller. The last years of his life Maimon spent in
Silesia, on the estate of his friend Count Kalkreuth, where
he continued his philosophic studies. He died in 1800, and
was buried in Glogau. During the last years of his life Maimon
was completely estranged from Judaism. He contributed next
to nothing to the enlightenment of his fellow-Jews, the only
work written by him in Hebrew being an uncompleted commentary
on Maimonides' "Guide of the Perplexed." Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
escaped the realm of darkness, he no more returned thither.
Nor perhaps was he able to do so without risking the same fate
as Uriel Acosta.</p>

<p>The time for cultural rejuvenation had not yet arrived for
the Jews of Poland and Lithuania. Least of all could such a
rejuvenation have been stimulated by the change in their
external, political situation: the transfer of the bulk of the
Jewish population from the power of disintegrating Poland
to that of Russia, a country even less civilized and built upon
the foundations of autocracy and serfdom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
THE RUSSIAN QUARANTINE AGAINST JEWS
(TILL 1772)</h2>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Anti-Jewish Attitude of Muscovy during the
Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries</span></p>


<p>The Empire of Muscovy, shut off from Western Europe by
a Chinese&mdash;or, more correctly, Byzantine&mdash;wall, maintained
during the sixteenth century its attitude of utmost prejudice
towards the Jews, and refused to admit them into its borders.
This prejudice was part of the general disfavor with which the
Russian people of that period, imbued as it was with the
traditions of Tataric-Byzantine culture, looked upon foreigners
or "infidels." But the prejudice against the Jews was fed,
in addition, from a specific source. The recollection of the
"Judaizing heresy" which had struck terror to the hearts
of the pious Muscovites at the end of the fifteenth and the
beginning of the sixteenth century<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> had not yet died out. The
Jews were regarded as dangerous magicians and seducers,
superstitious rumors ascribing all possible crimes to them.
The ambassador of the Muscovite Grand Duke, Basil III.,
at Rome, observed in 1526 to the Italian scholar Paolo Giovio:
"The Muscovite people dread no one more than the Jews, and
do not admit them into their borders."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>Jewish merchants of Poland and Lithuania visited occasionally,
in connection with their business affairs, the border city
Smolensk, but they had no permanent residence there. From
time to time they would carry their goods even into the capital,
Moscow, although such daring did not always pass unpunished.
About 1545 the goods imported by Jewish merchants from
Brest-Litovsk to Moscow were burned there, on which occasion
the Muscovite ambassador called the attention of the Polish
Government to the fact that the Jews had imported forbidden
merchandise to Russia, though they had not even the right to
travel thither. In 1550 the Polish King Sigismund Augustus
addressed a "charter" to Tzar Ivan the Terrible (Ivan IV.),
demanding the admission of Lithuanian Jews into Russia for
business purposes, by virtue of the former commercial treaties
between the two countries. Ivan IV. rejected this demand in
resolute terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is not convenient to allow Jews to come with their goods to
Russia, since many evils result from them. For they import
poisonous herbs [medicines] into our realm, and lead astray the
Russians from Christianity. Therefore he, the [Polish] King,
should no more write about these Jews.</p></div>

<p>Ivan the Terrible soon had occasion to demonstrate concretely
that he was not inclined to tolerate Jews in his domains.
When, in 1563, the Russian troops occupied the Polish border
city Polotzk,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> the Tzar gave orders to have all local Jews
converted to the Greek Orthodox faith, and those who refused
baptism drowned in the Dvina. His attitude towards the Poles
was more indulgent. He contented himself in their case
with taking them captive and demolishing their churches.
Fortunately a few years later, in 1579, Polotzk was restored to
Poland through the bravery of Stephen Batory, the protector
of the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>These primitive forms of denominational politics continued
for a long time to prevail in Muscovy. The Jews of Poland
and Lithuania managed, though illegally, to visit the capital
in the interest of their business. With the influx of Poles into
Moscow during the so-called "period of unrest," the interregnum
preceding the establishment of the Romanov dynasty in
1613, a goodly number of Jews penetrated into Russia. The
Muscovites became alarmed, and their apprehensions found
expression in 1610, when the noblemen of Moscow were conducting
negotiations with Poland looking to the election of
the Polish Crown Prince Vladislav to the Russian throne.
An agreement was concluded, consisting of twenty clauses,
setting forth the conditions on which the noblemen were willing
to vote for Vladislav. The fourth clause of this agreement
runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No churches or temples of the Latin or any other faith shall
be allowed in Russia. No one shall be induced to adopt the
Roman or any other religion, and the Jews shall not be allowed
to enter the Muscovite Empire either on business or in connection
with any other affairs.</p></div>

<p>In these circumstances the Jews were deprived of all
opportunity to develop commercial life in the reactionary
Empire. Forty years later this same Empire pushed its way
into the territories of Poland and Lithuania, which were
populated by Jews, and the policy of Muscovy was destined to
reveal its creative genius in the domain of the Jewish question.</p>

<p>The first contact of the Muscovite Empire with large Jewish
masses took place when the province of Little Russia was
annexed by Tzar Alexis Michaelovich in 1654. When the
Russian troops, allied with the Cossacks, overran White Russia,
Lithuania, and the Ukraina, they were struck by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
undreamed-of spectacle of cities in which entire quarters were
populated by Jews, a strange people about which the unenlightened
Muscovites knew nothing except that once upon a time
they had crucified Christ, and for this reason were not allowed
to enter pious, Greek Orthodox Russia. Alexis Michaelovich
and his military commanders began after their own fashion
to play the masters in the temporarily occupied Polish provinces.
In Vilna and Moghilev the Jews were murdered, and
those who survived were expelled. In Vitebsk the Jews were
made prisoners of war, while in other cities they were assaulted
and plundered.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>As a result the Muscovite Empire soon found within its
precincts a strangely composed Jewish population, consisting
of prisoners of war, who had been carried off principally from
the border towns of the Government of Moghilev, and had been
deported to the central provinces of Russia, and in some cases
even as far as Siberia. By the Peace of Andrusovo, concluded
in 1667 between Russia and Poland, the prisoners of war of
both countries were given their freedom, but the captive Jews
were allowed to remain in Muscovy. These Jews formed the
nucleus of a small Jewish colony in Moscow, which grew up
gradually, and in which occasionally even converts were to be
found. It seems that with the aid of these "legal" Jewish
residents other "illegal" Jews, from the neighboring regions
of Lithuania and White Russia, managed to penetrate to
Moscow. A few Jewish merchants, particularly those trading
in cloth, succeeded in obtaining an official permit, the so-called
"red ticket," to visit the capital. However, in 1676 the prohibition
against Jews entering Moscow was renewed. Only in
the portion of the Ukraina which had been annexed by Russia,
in the provinces of Chernigov and Poltava, and a part of the
province of Kiev, there could still be found small groups of
Jews who had survived the Cossack massacres of 1648. Moreover,
from the Polish section of the Ukraina, Jews occasionally
came on business into these Cossack districts, notwithstanding
the fact that, according to Russian law, the Jews were barred
from residing within the borders of Little Russia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>2. <span class="smcap">The Jews under Peter I. and His Successors</span></p>

<p>This treatment of the Jews did not improve even in the
new Russia, in which Peter the Great, the Tzar-Reformer, "had
broken through a window into Europe." True, Peter's reforms
effected a change for the better in the attitude of the isolated,
unenlightened Empire towards foreigners, but this change did
not extend to the Jews. We know of no laws enacted during his
reign which might illustrate the views of the new Government
on the Jewish question. There is reason to believe that the
Tzar, in allowing the former enactments against the admission
of Jews into Russia to remain in force, took into account the
primitive habits and prejudices of his people. A contemporary
witness narrates that, in 1698, during Peter's stay in
Holland, the Jews of Amsterdam requested the burgomaster
Witsen to petition the Tzar concerning the admission of their
coreligionists into Russia. After listening to the convincing
arguments of Witsen, with whom he was on a very friendly
footing, Peter replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My dear Witsen, you know the Jews, and you know their character
and habits; you also know the Russians. I know both, and
believe me, the time has not yet come to unite the two nationalities.
Tell the Jews that I am obliged to them for their proposition, and
that I realize how advantageous their services would be to me, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>that I should have to pity them were they to live in the midst of
the Russians.</p></div>

<p>Discounting the element of anecdote in this story, we may
reasonably assume that Peter did not think it entirely harmless
for the Jewish emigrants to settle among the benighted
Russian masses, which had been accustomed to look upon the
Jew as some kind of sea-monster, and as an infidel and Christ-killer.
It is possible that Peter was prompted by similar considerations
when he refused to admit the Jews into the central
provinces of Russia.</p>

<p>However, from another source we learn that the "reformer"
of Russia was not free from anti-Jewish prejudices, though
they were not always of a religious nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While inviting skilful foreigners from all over&mdash;says the Russian
historian Solovyov&mdash;Peter made a permanent exception but
for one people&mdash;the Jews. "I prefer," he was wont to say, "to see
in our midst nations professing Mohammedanism and paganism
rather than Jews. They are rogues and cheats. It is my endeavor
to eradicate evil and not to multiply it. They shall not be allowed
either to live or to trade in Russia, whatever efforts they may
make, and however much they may try to bribe those near me."</p></div>

<p>Of course, only a goodly dose of anti-Semitic bias could
prompt a view which regards in this light the economic activity
of the Jews among the Russian merchants, those same merchants
who had of yore given expression to their commercial
principles in the well-known Russian dictum, "If you don't
cheat, you don't sell."</p>

<p>It is possible that Peter was not unfamiliar with anti-Jewish
prejudices of a more objectionable kind. In 1702 reports were
received in Moscow from Little Russia, that in the town of
Gorodnya, near Chernigov, "the Jews had tortured a Christian
to death, and had sent his blood to a number of Jews in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Little Russian towns." The descendants of Khmelnitzki had
evidently succeeded in importing into Russia what was at that
time a fashionable article in Poland, the charge of ritual murder,
and these obscure rumors may have affected injuriously
the attitude of the Russian Tzar towards the Jews.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we are informed that, during the Russo-Swedish
War, when the Russian army was operating on the
Polish border territory, populated by Jews, Peter the Great
refrained from repeating the pogrom experiments of his
father, Alexis Michaelovich. In August, 1708, shortly before
the celebrated battle at Lesnaya, in White Russia, he checked
a military riot against the Jews which had been started in
Mstislavl. A brief Hebrew entry in the local Kahal journal,
or <i>Pinkes</i>, runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the twenty-eighth of Elul, in the year 5468, there came the
Cæsar, who is called the Tzar of Muscovy, by the name of Peter,
the son of Alexis, with his whole suite, an immense, numberless
host. Robbers and murderers from among his people fell upon us,
without his knowledge, and it almost came to bloodshed. And if
the Lord Almighty had not put it into the heart of the Tzar to
enter our synagogue in his own person, blood would certainly have
been shed. It was only with the help of God that the Tzar saved
us, and took revenge for us, by giving orders that thirteen men
from among them [the rioters] be immediately hanged, and the
land became quiet.</p></div>

<p>During the last years of his reign, Peter began to admit
Jewish financial agents to his new capital, St. Petersburg.
One of the most energetic financial agents at that time was
the "court Jew" Lipman Levy, a banker from Courland, who
attained to particular prominence under Peter's successors.</p>

<p>Under the immediate successors of Peter the Great the
"defensive" policy towards the Jews gradually became an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
"offensive" one. The magnates at the Russian court, who
dominated Russia under the label of "The Supreme Secret
Council," called attention to the unnecessary proximity of the
Jewish colony in Smolensk to the center of the Empire. The
district of Smolensk bordering on Poland harbored a group
of White Russian Jews, who earned a livelihood by a trade
profitable at that time, the lease of excise and customs duties.
One of these big tax-farmers, a certain Borukh Leibov (son of
Leib), even had the courage to build a synagogue for the
few Jews of the village of Zverovich. This aroused the
ire of the local Greek Orthodox priest, who in his <i>naïveté</i>
was convinced that the establishment of a synagogue would
result in diverting his flock from the Church and converting
it to Judaism. The inhabitants began to bombard St.
Petersburg with their protests, the elders of the Holy Synod
became alarmed, the specter of the "Judaizing heresy" once
more flitted across their vision, and, as a result, Empress
Catherine I. issued, in March, 1727, an ukase<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> through the
Supreme Secret Council, that Borukh and his associates be
removed from their office in connection with the excise and
customs duties, and "be deported immediately from Russia
beyond the border."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>A month later another even stricter ukase was promulgated
by the Empress through the Supreme Secret Council, which affected
all Jews in the border provinces, particularly those residing
in Little Russia. The ukase decreed that "the Jews, both
of the male and the female sex, who have settled in the Ukraina
and in other Russian cities, be deported immediately from
Russia beyond the border, and in no circumstances be admitted
into Russia, of which fact they shall in all places be strictly
forewarned." The exiles were forbidden to carry gold and
silver coins abroad, into the Polish dominions. They were
ordered to exchange them for copper money prior to their
expulsion. This ukase was a gross violation not only of the
ancient rights of the Jews who had been left in Little Russia
after its annexation by Muscovy, but also of the autonomy
of the province and its elective authorities, the hetmans, to
whom the right of initiative belonged in such cases.</p>

<p>The arbitrariness of the central Government called forth the
protest of the Little Russian Cossacks, who were otherwise far
from friendly to the Jews. In the name of "the Zaporozhian
army on both sides of the Dnieper"<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Hetman Daniel Apostol
addressed a petition to St. Petersburg, pleading for the admission
of traveling Jewish salesmen to the Little Russian
fairs, in view of their commercial usefulness. A reply to
this petition may be found in an ukase which the Supreme
Secret Council issued in 1728, in the name of Emperor
Peter II., the latter still being a minor. One of its clauses
runs thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Jews are permitted to visit temporarily the fairs of Little
Russia for commercial purposes, but they are only allowed to sell
their goods wholesale, and not retail, by ells and in pounds. The
money taken in from the sale of these goods shall be used to buy
other goods. In no circumstances shall they be allowed to carry
gold and silver money from Little Russia abroad.... The [permanent]
residence of the Jews in Little Russia is forbidden by
virtue of the ukase of the previous year, 1727.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>In this way the Jews who had been illegally deported were
now "graciously" granted the right of temporary visits to the
fairs. Moreover, even this right was hedged about by severe
restrictions, such as the prohibition of retail business, and the
compulsion of leaving in the country the money taken in for
their goods, for the purpose of equalizing imports and exports.</p>

<p>In 1731, this act of "grace" was extended to the Government
of Smolensk, and three years later another concession
was wrested from the authorities. The representatives of the
"Border Province of Sloboda," the present Government of
Kharkov, petitioned the Russian ruler to grant permission to
the Jews visiting the fairs to sell their goods not only wholesale
but also retail, "by ells and in pounds," in view of the fact
that "in the Sloboda regiments there are few business men,
and their trade is unsatisfactory." Empress Anna complied
with the request in 1774. In the same year the privilege concerning
the retail trade of Jews at the fairs was extended to
the whole of Little Russia, in compliance with a petition of its
Christian inhabitants.</p>

<p>But this avalanche of "favors" and "privileges"&mdash;the
partial restoration of rights which had been grossly trampled
upon&mdash;suddenly stopped, and was followed by a series of cruel
repressions. The change was prompted by the Muscovite fear
of Jews, the traditional dread felt by the Russian people of the
specter of "Jewish seduction." An occurrence had taken
place which was enough to strike terror to the hearts of
people with old Muscovite notions. The above-mentioned tax-farmer
of Smolensk, Borukh Leibov, who, even after his expulsion,
continued to cross the forbidden Polish-Russian frontier,
had occasion, during his stay in Moscow, to come in close
contact with Alexander Voznitzin, a retired captain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
navy, and "seduced him." Voznitzin, who was wont to
speculate about religious matters, studied the Bible under the
guidance of his Jewish friend, and his eyes were opened. He
realized that the Biblical doctrine of one God was incompatible
with the dogmas of the Greek Church and with the cult of
ikons, in which he had been brought up. Voznitzin became
convinced of the truth of Judaism, and, having made up his
mind to embrace the Jewish religion, he decided to brave the
difficulties and dangers which such a step implied. He went to
the little town of Dubrovna, in the Government of Moghilev,
near Smolensk, where the son of Borukh Leibov resided, to
undergo there the ceremony of circumcision and accept the
principles and practices of Judaism. Voznitzin's conversion
became known, and the Captain, together with his teacher
Borukh, were brought to justice. They were conveyed to St.
Petersburg, and turned over to the awe-inspiring "Chancellery
for Secret Inquisitorial Affairs."</p>

<p>The accused were put on the rack and confessed their
"crimes." Voznitzin admitted having embraced "the Jewish
law," and having uttered "blasphemous words against the
Holy Church," while Borukh Leibov owned that he had
"seduced" Voznitzin from the path of Greek Orthodoxy. In
addition, Borukh was accused of having, "together with other
Jews," predisposed the common people in Smolensk in favor
of the Jewish religion, and of having insulted, by word and
deed, the local Russian Pope Abramius, in connection with
the establishment of a Jewish synagogue in the village of
Zverovich. The latter crimes, however, were not investigated
further in view of the fact that the conversion of Voznitzin
was sufficient to inflict the death penalty on Borukh. The
Inquisitorial Court hastened to announce its verdict, basing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
it upon the "statute" of Tzar Alexis Michaelovich. The
report of the Senate elicited in 1738 an Imperial resolution,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
decreeing that "both of them [Voznitzin and Borukh] shall
be executed and burned, in order that other ignorant and
godless people, witnessing this, shall not turn away from the
Christian law, and such seducers as the above-mentioned Jew
Borukh shall not dare to lead them astray from the Christian
law and convert them to their own laws." The <i>auto-da-fé</i>
took place in St. Petersburg, on a public square, in the presence
of a large crowd of spectators, on July 15, 1738.</p>

<p>This one isolated incident was sufficient to rekindle in the
Government circles of St. Petersburg the inveterate Muscovite
hatred against "unbaptized Jews" and to justify
further violence against them. It had come to the knowledge
of the authorities that, contrary to the ukase of 1727, numerous
Jews were still residing in Little Russia, being employed
on the estates of the Russian landowners as arendars and innkeepers.
It had also been ascertained that the Jews who came
from the Polish part of the Ukraina to visit the fairs in many
cases settled permanently in Little Russia. The Government
found such a state of affairs unendurable. In 1739 the Senate
decreed the expulsion of the Jews from Little Russia, whither
in recent years they had penetrated "from the other side of the
Dnieper." In reply to this Senatorial rescript, the Military
Chancellery of Little Russia reported that an immediate expulsion
of the Jews was fraught with danger, on account of the
war with Turkey, which was going on at that time, "since their
present expulsion might be accompanied by spying." The
Cabinet of Ministers, acting upon the representation of the
Senate, passed the resolution, that "the expulsion of the Jews
shall be postponed until the termination of the present Turkish
War." When the war was over, Empress Anna issued an
ukase, in 1740, ordering the execution of the postponed expulsion.
The number of Jews liable to expulsion was found to be
292 of the male sex and 281 of the female sex, who resided
on 130 manorial estates, altogether a handful of 573 Jewish
souls, who had obtained shelter on the outskirts of Russia.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span><span class="smcap">3. Elizabeth Petrovna and the First Years of
Catherine II.</span></p>

<p>The policy of religious intolerance was practiced assiduously
during the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna (1741-1761). During
the reign of this Empress, who divided her time between
church services and court-balls, the persecutions of the adherents
of other faiths were intensified. By order of the Holy
Synod and the Senate, Greek Orthodoxy began to be disseminated
among the pagan nationalities of the East, while those of
them who, under the influence of the Tatars, had embraced
Mohammedanism, were subjected to fines unless they adopted
the religion of the state. In the hope of suppressing the
Mohammedan propaganda, orders were given to demolish the
mosques in many villages of the Governments of Kazan and
Astrakhan. The destruction of the mosques was stopped only
by the fear of Turkish reprisals, "in order that this rumor
shall not reach those countries in which adherents of the
Greek Orthodox persuasion live in the midst of Mohammedans,
and that the churches existing there shall not suffer oppression."</p>

<p>The Jews living in the border provinces were subjected to
similar treatment: they were expelled with one hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
pushed into the doors of the church with the other. Towards
the end of 1741, Elizabeth Petrovna issued a remarkable ukase.
Referring to the decree of 1727 concerning the expulsion of
Jews, the Empress states that "it has now come to our knowledge
that some Jews in our Empire, and particularly in
Little Russia, continue to live there under all kinds of pretence,
being engaged in business or in keeping inns and taverns,
from which circumstance no benefit of any kind, but, coming
from such <i>haters of the name of our Savior Christ</i>, only
extreme injury, can accrue to our faithful subjects." Hence
the Empress "most graciously" commands that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>from our whole Empire, both from the Great Russian and Little
Russian cities, villages, and hamlets, all Jews of the male and
female sex, of whatever calling and dignity they may be, shall, at
the publication of this our ukase, be immediately deported with all
their property abroad, and shall henceforward, under no pretext,
be admitted into our Empire for any purpose; unless they shall
be willing to accept the Christian religion of the Greek persuasion.
Such [Jews], having been baptized, shall be allowed to
live in our Empire, but they shall not be permitted to go outside
the country.</p></div>

<p>The ukase was to be printed and promulgated in the whole
Empire, so as to gain wide circulation among the people and to
inculcate in the Russian masses the proper sentiments towards
"the haters of the name of our Savior Christ."</p>

<p>However, the Empress and her exalted prompters calculated
wrongly. The cruel expulsion decree did not draw a single
Jew into the fold of the Greek Orthodox Church, while the
reason given in the ukase for the expulsion, "the extreme
injury" inflicted by the enemies of Christ "upon our faithful
subjects," failed to carry conviction to the latter. The ukase
had been designed in particular to "benefit" the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of the two border provinces of Little Russia and Livonia
by eliminating the Jews from their midst. These inhabitants,
however, speaking through their local representatives, declared
that such "beneficence" would only result in ruining them.
From Little Russia the Greek contractors of the customs duties
complained to the Senate that the repressions against the
Jews, which hampered their commercial visits to Poland, had
caused great losses to the state revenues by lowering the income
from imported goods, that a sudden expulsion of Jews, who
were bound up with the Christian merchants by business interests
and monetary obligations, would ruin both sides, and that
it was therefore necessary to allow the Jews to retain their
former right of free admission into Little Russia for business
purposes.</p>

<p>Even more energetic representations were sent to the Senate
from the Baltic province of Livonia. The gubernatorial administration
of the province and the magistracy of the city
of Riga stated that, in accordance with the promulgated ukase,
the Jews living in the suburb of Riga and in the surrounding
district had been ordered to leave within six weeks, but that
this expulsion was bound to cause great injury to the exchequer
and to spell ruin for the whole mercantile class. For the
Polish pans and merchants, who had their Jewish brokers in
Riga, would stop buying their goods there, and would prefer to
import them, with the aid of their expelled Jewish middlemen,
from Germany, so that "trade in Riga would fall off, and
commerce might be destroyed entirely," the Russian merchants
finding themselves unable to secure customers for "the goods
imported by sea." The Livonians therefore pleaded to grant
the Jews free admission into Riga for carrying on business,
though it be only in the capacity of temporary residents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Impressed by these representations, the Senate submitted a
report to the Empress, in which it endeavored to convince her
that for the sake of "promoting commerce," increasing the
revenues of the exchequer, and guarding the interests of the
Christian population in the "border localities," it was necessary
to comply with the petitions of the Ukrainians and
Livonians and grant the Jews free admission to both provinces
and to other localities on the frontier, so that they may
carry on temporary business during the time of the fairs, this
privilege having been exercised by them in Little Russia since
1728, by virtue of earlier Imperial decrees. Elizabeth Petrovna
read these convincing arguments of the Senate, but, blinded by
religious fanaticism, refused to pay attention to them. On the
reports submitted by the Senate, she put down, in December,
1743, the following laconic resolution<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>: "From the enemies
of Christ I desire neither gain nor profit."</p>

<p>The Senate could do nothing but submit to the despotic
will of the Empress. A month later, in January, 1744, an ukase
was issued, demanding that immediate steps be taken to detect
the Jews in Little Russia, Livonia, and other places, and expel
all except those who were willing to be baptized.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Henceforward&mdash;the Senatorial decree runs&mdash;the above Jews
shall not by any means, under any conditions, and for any purpose
whatsoever, be admitted into Russia, though it be for the fairs
or for a short time only; nor shall any representations concerning
their admission be further addressed to the Senate, and the Senate
shall be duly informed when all the above [Jews] shall have been
expelled.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>In this manner Elizabeth Petrovna cleared these provinces
of their Jewish population, where&mdash;for better or for worse&mdash;it
had lived long before their annexation by Russia. A contemporary
historian calculates that up to his time (1753)
some 35,000 Jews had been banished from Russia.</p>

<p>The fanatical Empress searched with the vigilance of an
inquisitor for the slightest trace of Judaism in her Empire.
Since 1731 there had lived in St. Petersburg a learned physician,
by the name of Antonio Sanchez, evidently a Sephardic
Marano, who professed Judaism in secret. Originally invited
from Holland, Sanchez occupied in St. Petersburg the post
of body-physician at the courts of Anna Johannovna and her
successors, and he was at the same time in charge of the medical
department of the army. He subsequently became a
member of the Academy of Sciences, and wrote a number of
medical works, which drew the attention of the scientific
world to him. In 1749 Sanchez was suddenly dismissed from
the Academy of Sciences, and compelled to transfer his abode
to Paris. It seems that Empress Elizabeth had found out
the secret "crime" of her body-physician, which was none
other than his loyalty to Judaism. "As far as I am aware"&mdash;the
president of the Academy, Razumovski, wrote to Sanchez&mdash;"you
have not been guilty of any wrong-doing against her
Imperial Majesty or against any of her interests. But she
finds it contrary to her conscience to tolerate in the Academy
a man who has deserted the banner of Christ, and has joined
the ranks of those who fight under the banner of Moses and
the Old Testament prophets." When the famous mathematician
Euler heard of Sanchez' expulsion, he wrote: "I doubt
whether amazing actions of this kind will contribute towards
the reputation of the Russian Academy of Sciences."</p>

<p>There was no one perhaps in the contemporary Government
circles of Russia who was so ready to condemn this malicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
policy, inspired by Byzantine clericalism, as that cultured
"Westerner," Empress Catherine II. (1762-1796). Nevertheless
in the first years of her reign she found herself unable to
change a policy which had already been hallowed by tradition,
and was regarded as "national" and truly Russian.
Catherine II., in endeavoring to justify the dethronement of
her husband, the Prussophil Peter III., was bound, in the first
years of her reign, to act against her own convictions and
pose as a national ruler, anxious to follow in the footsteps of
her Orthodox predecessors. We derive our knowledge of
this fact from her own memoirs, in which, speaking of herself
in the third person, she makes this confession:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the fifth or sixth day after her accession to the throne,
Catherine II. arrived at the Senate. It happened that on the
agenda of that session was the question of the admission of Jews
into Russia. The Senators unanimously declared that their admission
was useful, but Catherine, in view of the circumstances at the
time, found it difficult to give her assent. The Senator Count
Odoyevski came to her aid. He rose up and said: "Before making
a decision, perhaps your Imperial Majesty will consent to see
the autograph decision which on a similar occasion was rendered
by Empress Elizabeth." Catherine ordered the documents to be
brought, and she found that Empress Elizabeth, prompted by piety,
had written on the margin, "From the enemies of Christ I desire
neither gain nor profit." It is necessary to observe that less than
a week had passed since Catherine's accession to the throne. She
had been placed on it for the defense of the Greek Orthodox faith;
she had to deal with a pious people and with a clergy to which its
estates had not yet been returned, and which, in consequence of
this ill-fitting measure, had nothing to live on. The minds, as is
always the case after such a great upheaval [the violent death
of Peter III.], were in a state of great excitement. To begin
her reign by the admission of Jews would not at all have helped to
pacify their minds; to declare it as injurious was also impossible.
Catherine acted simply: when the Procurator-General collected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>the votes and approached her for her decision, she said to him,
"I desire that this matter be postponed for another time." Thus
it often happens that it is not enough to be enlightened, to have
good intentions, and even the power to realize them.</p></div>

<p>In this way, in spite of the unanimous opinion of the Senate,
that the admission of Jews was beneficial to Russia, and in
spite of her own liberal frame of mind, Catherine II. left the
Jewish question in its former state, being afraid of arousing
against her the resentment of the reactionary element of the
Russian people. In the very same year, on December 4, 1762,
the Empress, in issuing a manifesto permitting all foreigners
to travel and to settle in Russia, added the fatal formula,
<i>kromye Zhydov</i> ("except the Jews").</p>

<p>Two years later, in 1764, Catherine II. received a petition
from the Little Russian nobles and elders, who, together with
the hetman, pleaded for the restoration of the autonomous
"ancient rights" of Little Russia, which had been grossly
violated by the Russian Government. Out of the twenty
clauses of the document, one refers to the Jews. The representatives
of the Little Russian people declare that the law
barring Jews from entering their province had inflicted great
damage on the local trade, because the Jews, "being inhabitants
of a neighboring state, take a very large part in Little
Russian commerce, buying the goods of Little Russia at a
much larger price, and the foreign goods at a smaller price, as
compared with that now prevailing." The petition concludes
with these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the above-mentioned Jews be granted domicile in Little
Russia, with this we dare not trouble your Imperial Majesty. All
we do is to plead most humbly that, <i>for the sake of promoting
Little Russian commerce</i>, the Jews be allowed to visit Little
Russia for free commercial transactions.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The petition was not granted, for even Catherine II. "dared
not" repeal the inquisitorial resolution of Elizabeth Petrovna
against "the enemies of Christ."</p>

<p>It was amidst conditions such as these that the event which
marks a critical juncture in the history of the Jewish people
took place. Starting with the year 1772, Russia began to
acquire the inheritance of disintegrating Poland. The country
which had stood in fear of a few thousand Jews was now
forced to accept them, at one stroke, by the tens of thousands
and, shortly afterwards, by the hundreds of thousands. Subsequent
history will show in what way Russia endeavored to
solve this conflict between her anti-Jewish traditions and the
necessity of harboring in her dominions the greatest center of
the Jewish Diaspora.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
POLISH JEWRY DURING THE PERIOD OF THE
PARTITIONS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">1. The Jews of Poland after the First Partition</span></p>

<p>On the eve of the great crisis which overtook the Jews of
Western Europe in the wake of the French Revolution, the
vast Jewish center in Eastern Europe was in a state of political
and social disintegration. We refer to the position of Polish
Jewry during the interval between the first partition of Poland
and the second (1772-1793).</p>

<p>The first vivisection had just been performed on the diseased
organism of the Polish Republic.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Russia had chopped off one
flank&mdash;the province of White Russia<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>; Austria had seized
Galicia, and Prussia had helped herself to Pomerania and a
part of the province of Posen. Correspondingly the compact
organism of Polish Jewry was divided among the three Powers.
One section of this huge mass, which lived a secluded and
thoroughly original life of its own, suddenly became the object
of "reformatory" experiments in the laboratory of Joseph II.
Another section found itself in the rôle of a "tolerated" population
in the royal barracks of Frederick II., who would fain
have acquired the Polish provinces minus their Jewish inhabitants.
A third portion came under the sway of Russia, a
country which had not yet become reconciled to the presence
of a handful of Jews on the border of her Empire, in the province
of Little Russia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>What was left of Polish Jewry after the surgical operation
of 1772 experienced, after its own fashion, all the pre-mortal
agonies of the doomed commonwealth, which was destined to
undergo two more partitions. Dying Poland was tossing about
restlessly, endeavoring to prolong its existence by the enactments
of the Permanent Council or by the reforms of the
Quadrennial Diet (1788-1791).<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> In connection with the general
reforms of the country the need was felt of curing the old
specific ailment of Poland, the Jewish Problem. The finance
committee of the Quadrennial Diet gathered all available information
concerning the number of Jews in the reduced kingdom
and their economic and cultural status.</p>

<p>The following are the results of this official investigation,
as embodied in the report of one of the members of the committee,
the well-known historian Thaddeus Chatzki, who made
a special study of the Jewish problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>Officially the number of Jews residing in Poland and Lithuania
about the year 1788 was computed at 617,032. Chatzki,
fortified by an array of additional data, rightly points out
that, owing to the fact that fiscal considerations caused the
people to evade the official census, the actual number of Jews
mounted up to at least 900,000 souls of both sexes. This computation
agrees substantially with the authoritative statement
of Butrymovich, a member of the "Jewish Commission"
appointed by the Quadrennial Diet. For, according to this
statement, the Jews of Poland formed an eighth of the whole
population, the latter numbering 8,790,000 souls. The Jewish
population, thus amounting to practically one million, multiplied
rapidly, owing to the custom of early marriages then
in vogue. The same custom, on the other hand, was responsible
for increased mortality among Jewish children and for
an ever-growing physical deterioration of the adolescent generation.
The school training received by Jewish children was
limited to the study of the religious literature of Judaism,
particularly the Talmud.</p>

<p>As regards commerce, the Jews figured in it in the following
proportions: 75% of the whole export trade of Poland and
10% of the imports lay in their hands. The living expenses
of the Jewish business man were half as large as those of his
Christian fellow-merchant, which fact enabled the Jew to sell
his goods at a much lower figure. Bankruptcy was more frequent
among Jewish business men than among Christians. In
the provinces outside of Great Poland half of all the artisans
were Jews. Shoemakers, tailors, furriers, goldsmiths, carpenters,
stone-cutters, and barbers, were particularly numerous
among them. In the whole country only fourteen Jewish
families were found to engage in agriculture. Wealth among
Jews was but very seldom retained for several successive generations
within the same family, owing to frequent bankruptcy
and to a propensity towards risky speculations. A
twelfth part of the Jewish population was made up of "idlers,"
that is, people without a definite occupation. A sixtieth part
consisted of beggars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>To these deductions, based on official findings, as well as on
outside observation, the important fact must be added that
one of the main pursuits of the Jews at that time was the liquor
traffic, that is, the keeping of taverns in the towns and villages.
As far as the manorial estates were concerned, the sale of
liquors was closely connected with land-leasing and innkeeping.
In leasing from the noble landowner the various items of
agrarian wealth, such as dairies, pastures, timber, etc., the
Jew farmed at the same time the "propination," the right of
distilling and selling spirits in the taverns and inns. These
pursuits often resulted in a clash between the Jew and the
peasant, that outlawed serf who was driven to the tavern,
not by opulence, but by extreme poverty and suffering, brought
upon him by the heavy hand of the aristocratic landlord.
The final stage in the economic breakdown of the peasant
was reached at the door of the tavern, and the Jewish liquor-dealer
was in consequence looked upon as the despoiler of
the peasant. This accusation against the Jews was brought
forward by the slaveholding magnates, who were the real cause
of the impoverishment of their peasant serfs, and pocketed
the proceeds of the "propination" which they let out to the
Jews.</p>

<p>As for the Jews themselves, there is no doubt that the traffic
in liquor had a demoralizing effect upon them. The position
of the Jewish arendar, sandwiched between the spendthrifty
and eccentric pan, on the one hand, and the downtrodden
khlop, on the other, was far from enviable. In the eyes of
the landowner the arendar was nothing but a servant, who
received no better treatment at his hands than the khlop. If
perchance the roads or bridges on the estate were found in bad
condition, the arendar would sometimes be subjected to corporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
punishment for it. When the pan engaged in one of his
frequent orgies, the first victims of his recklessness were the
arendar and his family. A good illustration is afforded by an
entry in the diary of a Volhynian country squire, from the
year 1774:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The arendar Hershko<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> has remained ninety-one thaler in arrears
from last term. I was forced to attach his goods. According to
the clause of the contract I have the right, in case of non-payment,
to keep him with his wife and children in prison as long as I like,
until he pays up. I gave orders to have him put in chains and
locked up in the pig-sty together with the swine; the wife and the
bahurs [young sons] I left in the inn, except for the youngest son
Layze [Lazarus]. The latter I took to the manor, and I had him instructed
in the [Catholic] catechism and the prayers.</p></div>

<p>The boy in question was forced to make the sign of the cross
and to eat pork. Only the arrival of Jews from Berdychev,
who remitted the debt of the arendar, saved the father from
imprisonment and the son from enforced conversion.</p>

<p>It is interesting to inquire into the causes which drove the
Jewish populace into the unenviable pursuits of land-leasing
and rural liquor-dealing. Although forming but one-eighth of
the population of Poland, the Jews furnished 50% of the whole
number of artisans in the realm and 75% of those engaged in the
export trade&mdash;the export, be it noted, of agricultural products,
such as timber, flax, skins, and all kinds of raw material. All
these occupations were obviously insufficient for their maintenance.
In Poland no less than in Western Europe neither the
mercantile guilds nor the trade-unions, which to a considerable
extent were made up of Germans, admitted Jewish artisans
and merchants into their corporations, and as a result the
sphere of Jewish activity was extremely limited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>The same burghers and business men were also the predominating
element in the composition of the magistracies,
and in the majority of cities it lay in their power to grant or
refuse licenses to their Jewish competitors for pursuing commerce
or handicrafts. The clause in the Polish parliamentary
Constitution of 1768, which placed the economic activity of
the Jews in the cities under the control of the magistracies,
might have been literally dictated by the latter. It ran as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas the Jews inflict intolerable damage upon the cities and
the burghers, and rob them of their means of subsistence...,
be it resolved that in all towns and townlets in which the Jews
have no special, constitutionally guaranteed privileges, they be
forced to conduct themselves according to the agreements entered
into with the municipalities, and be forbidden, on pain of severe
fines, to arrogate to themselves any further rights.</p></div>

<p>It goes without saying that these "agreements" with the
Christian business men consisted as a rule in nothing else
than the prohibition or limitation of local Jewish competition.
In this manner the originators of the parliamentary Constitution,
the landed proprietors and townspeople, were those
who forced the Jews out of the cities, and drove them into
land-leasing and liquor-dealing.</p>

<p>The parliamentary Constitution of 1775, which was promulgated
after the first partition of Poland, and instituted a
supreme administrative body, the Permanent Council, increased
the Jewish per capita tax from two gulden to three,
to be levied on both male and female, and including the new-born.
It also made the attempt, though not after the cruel
pattern of Western Europe, to place certain restrictions on
Jewish marriages. The rabbis were interdicted from performing
the marriage service for the Jews who were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
engaged in one of the legitimate occupations, such as handicrafts,
commerce, agriculture, or manual labor, or who were
unable to indicate their sources of livelihood. Parenthetically
it may be remarked that this law was never applied in practice.</p>

<p>Ancient Poland never had a "Pale of Settlement," the Jews
being merely barred from residing in several so-called "privileged"
towns. One of these forbidden places was the capital,
Warsaw.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The Jews had long been refused the right of permanent
settlement in that city. They were only allowed to
sojourn there temporarily during the sessions of the various
Diets, simultaneously with which the commercial fairs were
generally timed to take place.</p>

<p>The parliamentary Constitution of 1768, in sanctioning this
"ancient custom" of admitting the Jews temporarily into
Warsaw, gave as its reason "the common welfare and the necessity
of reducing the high cost of merchandise," this high cost
resulting invariably from the absence of Jewish competition.
In the capital the following procedure became customary: two
weeks prior to the opening of the Diet the Crown Marshal
informed the inhabitants of Warsaw by trumpet blasts that
visiting Jews were permitted to engage in commerce and
handicrafts, and two weeks after the conclusion of the session
of the Diet trumpet blasts again heralded the fact that it was
time for the Jews to take to their heels. Those who were slow
in leaving the city were expelled by the police. As a rule, however,
the exiles managed, under all sorts of pretexts, to return
the day after their expulsion, in the capacity of new arrivals,
and they continued to reside in the city for several weeks by
"persuading" the inspectors of the marshal. As a result,
Crown Marshal Lubomirski established a system of tickets for
visiting Jews, each ticket costing a silver groschen, which
granted the right of a five days' sojourn in the capital. Without
such a ticket no Jew dared show himself on the street.
The collection from these tickets netted an annual income of
some 200,000 gulden for the marshal's treasury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>When some of the high Polish dignitaries, who owned entire
districts in Warsaw, made the discovery that it was possible to
convert Jewish rightlessness into cash, they began, for a definite
consideration, to accord permission to the Jews to settle on their
estates, which lay beyond the city ramparts. In this way there
gradually came into being a settlement known under the
name of New Jerusalem. The Christian burghers of Warsaw
raised a terrible outcry demanding the literal application
of the law which barred the Jews from settling permanently
in the capital. Thereupon Lubomirski adopted stringent
measures against the Jews, notwithstanding the protests of the
highly-placed house-owners and regardless even of the intervention
of the King. On January 22, 1775, the Jews were
expelled from Warsaw; their homes in New Jerusalem were
demolished, and all their goods were transferred to the armory
or the barracks, where they were sold at public auction.</p>

<p>This was a severe blow to the mercantile Jewish population,
which was now cut off from the political and industrial center
of the country. The Jews had to content themselves again
with temporary visits during the short term of the parliamentary
sessions. In the course of time the former evasion
of the law came into vogue again. In 1784 the administration,
appealed to by the magistracy, once more undertook to
clear the capital of Jews. The situation was modified somewhat
towards the end of 1788, when the Quadrennial Diet
began its sessions. The Jews were inclined to assume that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
inasmuch as the Diet was sitting permanently, their right of
residence in the capital was no longer subject to a time limit.
Accordingly the Jews began to flock to Warsaw, and several
thousands of them were soon huddled together in the center of
the city. This of course aroused the ire of the burghers and
the magistracy against the new-comers, resulting subsequently
in a sanguinary conflict.</p>

<p>In this manner law and life were constantly at odds, life
turning law into fiction whenever in opposition to its demands,
and law retaliating by dealing occasional blows at life.</p>

<p>The million Jews pressed their way into the eight millions
of the native population like a wedge, which, once having
entered, could not be displaced. For by occupying the originally
empty place of the mercantile estate, the Jews had
for many centuries served, so to speak, as a tie between the
bipartite nation of nobles and serfs. Now a new wedge, the
Christian middle class, was endeavoring to displace the Jewish
element, but it failed in its efforts. For the Jewish population
had become inextricably entwined with the economic organism
of Poland, though remaining a stranger to its national and
spiritual aspirations. This was the tragic aspect of the Jewish
question in Poland in the period of the partitions.</p>

<p>Deeply stirred by the catastrophe of 1772, Poland fell to
making reforms as a means of salvation. She was anxious to
expiate her old sins and turn over a new leaf. Here she found
herself face to face with the Jewish problem: a huge and compact
population of different birth and creed, with an autonomous
communal life, with a separate language, and with customs
and manners of its own, was scattered all over the realm
and interwoven with all branches of economic endeavor. This
secluded population, which Polish legislation no less than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
arrogance of the nobility and the intolerance of the Church had
estranged from political and civil life, survived as a relic of the
old order, which was now tottering to its fall. The ruling class,
which had brought about this state of things, was naturally
loth to acknowledge its responsibility for the decomposition
of Poland, and so the guilt was thrown on the shoulders of the
Jews, in spite of the fact that their position was merely the
product of the general caste structure of the nation. And
when, in a fit of repentance, Poland began to dig down into
her past, she discovered that one of her "sins" was the Jewish
question, and she was bent on solving it.</p>

<p>Two solutions presented themselves at that moment. The
one was of a repressive character, permeated with the old spirit
of the nobility and clergy. The other was of a comparatively
liberal character, and bore the impress of the policy of "compulsory
enlightenment" pursued by the Austrian Emperor
Joseph II. The former found its expression in the parliamentary
project of Zamoiski (1778-1780); the latter was
represented by the proposals of Butrymovich and Chatzki,
who submitted them to the liberally inclined Quadrennial Diet
in 1789.</p>

<p>One of the Polish historians rightly observes that "the celebrated
ex-Chancellor [Andreas Zamoiski] drafted this law
more for the purpose of getting rid of the Jews than of bringing
about their amalgamation with the national organism [of
Poland]." Zamoiski's project is semi-clerical and semi-bureaucratic
in character. The Jews are to be granted the right
of residence in those towns into which they had been admitted
by virtue of former agreements with the municipalities, while
other places are to be open to them only for temporary visits, to
attend markets and fairs. In the cities the Jews are to settle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
separate streets, away from the Christians. Every Jewish adult
is to present himself before the local administration and produce
a certificate to the effect that he is either a tradesman owning
property of the minimum value of a thousand gulden, or an
artisan, arendar, or agriculturist. Those who cannot prove that
they belong to one of these four categories shall be obliged to
leave the country within a year. In case they refuse to leave
voluntarily, they are to be placed under arrest, and sent to a
penitentiary. Moreover, the author of the project, repeating
the old ecclesiastic regulations, proposes to bar the Jews from
those financial and economic functions, such as the leasing of
crown lands, public contracts, and collection of revenues, in
which they might exercise some form of control over Christians.
For the same reason the Jews are to be interdicted from keeping
Christian help, and so forth. Compulsory conversion of Jews
is to be discountenanced; yet those already converted are to
be removed from their old environment, and not to be allowed
even to see their former coreligionists, except in the presence
of Christians.</p>

<p>The Catholic clergy was so well pleased with Zamoiski's
project that the Archbishop of Plotzk attached his signature
to it. Having fortified himself by ecclesiastical and police
safeguards, Zamoiski was at liberty to pay a scant tribute to
the spirit of the age by including in his project the principle
of the inviolability of the person and property of the Jew.
After binding the Jew hand and foot by these draconian
regulations there was indeed no necessity for further insulting
him.</p>

<p>An entirely different position is taken by the anonymous
author of a Polish pamphlet which appeared in Warsaw in
1782 under the title, "On the Necessity of Jewish Reforms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
in the Lands of the Polish Crown." The writer, who disguises
his identity under the pseudonym "A Nameless Citizen,"
is opposed to retrogressive measures, and favors legislation
of an utilitarian and enlightened character. As far as the
Jewish religion is concerned, he is willing to let the Jews keep
their dogmas, but deems it necessary to combat their "harmful
religious customs," such as the large number of festivals,
the dietary laws, and so forth. It is important in his opinion
to curtail their communal autonomy by confining it to religious
matters, so that the Jews shall not form a state within a state.
In order to stimulate the amalgamation of the Jews with the
Polish nation, they are to be compelled to adopt the Polish
language in their business dealings, to abandon the Yiddish
vernacular, and to be interdicted from printing Hebrew
books or importing them from abroad. On the economic
side the Jews are to be barred from keeping inns and selling
liquor in them, only handicrafts, honest business, and agriculture
being left open to them. In this way the project of the
"Nameless Citizen" seeks to render the Jews "innocuous"
by compulsory amalgamation, just as the preceding project of
Zamoiski endeavored to attain the same end by compulsory
isolation. After having been rendered "innocuous," the Jew
may be found worthy of receiving equal rights with his Christian
fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to discern in this project the influence of
Joseph II.'s policy, which similarly sought to effect the "improvement"
of the Jew through compulsory enlightenment
and his amalgamation with the native population, as a
preliminary for his attainment of equal rights. It seems that
the project met with a friendly reception in the progressive
circles of Polish society, which were animated by the ideas of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the eighteenth century. The anonymous pamphlet appeared in
a second edition in 1785, and a third edition was published in
1789 by Butrymovich, a deputy of the Quadrennial Diet, who
added comments of his own. A year later Butrymovich extracted
from his edition the project of Jewish reform, and laid
it before the committee of the Diet, which was then meeting
amidst the uproar of the great French Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>As for the inner life of this Jewish mass of one million
souls, it displays the same saddening spectacle of disintegration.
The social rottenness of the environment, the poison of
the decaying body of Poland, worked its way into Jewish life,
and began to undermine its foundations, once so firmly
grounded. The communal autonomy, which had been the
mainstay of public Jewish life, was unmistakably falling to
pieces. In the southwestern region, in Podolia, Volhynia, and
Galicia,&mdash;the last having been annexed by Austria,&mdash;it had
been shattered by the great religious split produced by
Hasidism. The Kahal organization was tottering to its fall,
either because of the division of the community into two hostile
factions, the Hasidim and Mithnagdim, or because of the
inertia of the Hasidic majority, which, blindly obeying the
dictates of the Tzaddik, was incapable of social organization.
In the northwestern region, in Lithuania and White Russia,&mdash;the
latter having become a Russian province&mdash;the rabbinical
party, going hand in hand with the Kahal authorities, was
superior to the forces of Hasidism. Nevertheless the Kahal
organization was infected by the general process of degeneration,
which had seized the country at large in the partition
period. The Jewish plutocracy followed the example of the
Polish pans in exploiting the poor laboring masses. The
rabbinate, like the Polish clergy, catered to the rich. The
secular and the ecclesiastic oligarchy, which controlled the
Kahal, victimized the community by a shockingly disproportionate
assessment of state and communal taxes, throwing the
main burden on the impecunious classes, and thus bringing
them to the verge of ruin. The <i>parnasim</i>, or wardens, of the
community, as well as the rabbis, were occasionally found
guilty of embezzlement, usury, and blackmail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>The oppression of the Kahal oligarchy went to such lengths
that the suffering masses, unmindful of the traditional prohibition
to appeal to the "law courts of the Gentiles," frequently
sought to obtain redress from the Christian administration
against these Jewish satraps. In 1782 representatives
of the lower classes, principally artisans, of the Jewish population
of Minsk, lodged a complaint with the Lithuanian
Financial Tribunal against the local Kahal administration,
which "was completely ruining the community of Minsk."
They alleged that the Kahal leaders embezzled the receipts from
taxation, and misappropriated the surplus for their own benefit,
that by means of the herem (excommunication) they squeezed
all kinds of revenues from the poor and appropriated their
hard-earned pennies. The complainants add that for their
attempt to lay bare the misdoings of the Kahal before the
administration, they had been arrested, imprisoned, and pilloried
in the synagogue by order of the Kahal wardens.</p>

<p>In Vilna, the capital of Lithuania, celebrated on account
of its aristocracy of mind as well as its aristocracy of birth,
a split occurred within the ranks of the Kahal oligarchy itself.
For nearly twenty years there was a conflict between the Rabbi,
a certain Samuel Vigdorovich (son of Avigdor), and the
Kahal, or, more correctly, between the rabbinical party and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Kahal party. The Rabbi had been convicted of corruption,
drunkenness, biased legal decisions, perjury, and so on. The
litigation between the Rabbi and the Kahal had, at an earlier
stage, been submitted to a court of arbitration as well as to a
conference of Lithuanian rabbis. Since the strife and agitation
in the city did not subside, both parties appealed, in 1785, to
Radziwill, the Voyevoda of Vilna, who decided in favor of the
Kahal, and dismissed the Rabbi from office.</p>

<p>The common people, standing between the two belligerent
parties, were particularly bitter towards the Kahal, whose
abuses and misdeeds exceeded all measure. A little later,
between 1786 and 1788, a champion of the people's cause
appeared in the person of Simeon Volfovich (son of Wolf),
who, acting as the spokesman of the Jewish masses of Vilna,
had to struggle and suffer on their behalf. To ward off
the persecution by the Kahal, Volfovich managed to obtain an
"iron letter" from King Stanislav Augustus, guaranteeing
inviolability of person and property to himself and to the
whole Jewish commonalty, "which the tyranny of the Kahal
had brought to the verge of ruin." This did not prevent the
Kahal authorities from subjecting Simeon to the herem and
entering his name in the "black book," while the Voyevoda,
who sided with the Kahal tyrants, sent the mutinous champion
of the people to the prison of Neswizh (1788). From there
the prisoner addressed his memorandum to the Quadrennial
Diet, emphasizing the need of a radical change in the communal
organization of the Jews, and urging the abolition of
the Kahal power, which pressed so heavily upon the people.
This struggle between the Kahal, the rabbinate, and the common
people shook to its foundations the social organization of
the Jews of Lithuania shortly before the incorporation of this
country into the Russian Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>A somber picture of the conduct of the communal oligarchy
is supplied by one of the few broad-minded rabbis of the
period:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The leaders [rabbis and elders] consume the offerings of the
people, and drink wine for the fines imposed by them. Being in
full control of the taxes, they assess and excommunicate [their
opponents]; they remunerate themselves for their public activity
by every means at their disposal, both openly and in secret. They
make no step without accepting bribes, while the destitute carry
the burden.... The learned cater to the rich, and, as for the
rabbis, they have only contempt for one another. The students of
the Talmud despise those engaged in mysticism and Cabala, while
the common people accept the testimony of both, and conclude that
all scholars are a disgrace to their calling.... The rich value
the favor of the Polish pans above the good opinion of the best and
noblest among the Jews. The rich Jew does not appreciate the
honor shown to him by a scholar, but boasts of having been
allowed to enter the mansion of a Polish noble and view his
treasures.</p></div>

<p>The rabbi complains in particular that the well-to-do
classes are obsessed by a love of show; that the women wear
strings of pearls around their necks, and array themselves
in many-colored fabrics.</p>

<p>The education of the young generation in the heders and
yeshibahs sank to ever lower depths. Instruction in the elements
of secular culture was entirely out of the question. The
Jewish school bore a purely rabbinical character. True, Talmudic
scholasticism succeeded in sharpening the intellect, but,
failing to supply concrete information, it often confused the
mind. Hasidism had wrested a huge piece of territory from
the dominion of Rabbinism, but, as far as education was concerned,
it was powerless to create anything new. The religious
and national sentiments of Polish Jewry had undergone a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
profound transformation at the hands of Hasidism, but the
transformation lured the Jews backward, far into the thickets
of mystical contemplation and blind faith, both subversive
of rational thinking and of any attempt at social reform.</p>

<p>In the last two decades of the eighteenth century, when the
banner of militant enlightenment was floating over German
Jewry, a bitter warfare between the Hasidim and Mithnagdim
was raging all along the line in Poland and Lithuania, with the
result that the consciousness of the political crisis through
which Polish Jewry was then passing was dimmed, and the
appeal from the West calling to enlightenment and progress
was silenced. The specter of German rationalism, which flitted
across the horizon of Polish Jewry, produced horror and consternation
in both camps. To be a "Berliner" was synonymous
with being an apostate. A Solomon Maimon was forced
to flee to Germany in order to gain access to the world of new
ideas, which were taboo in Poland.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">2. The Period of the Quadrennial Diet (1788-1791)</span></p>

<p>The first year of the French Revolution coincided with the
first year of Polish reform. In Paris the <i>états généraux</i>
were transformed, under the pressure of the revolutionary
movement, from a parliament of classes into a national assembly
representing the nation as a whole. In Warsaw the new
reform Diet, styled the Quadrennial, or the Great, though
essentially a parliament of the Shlakhta, and remaining
strictly within the old frame of class organization, reflected
nevertheless the influence of French ideas in their pre-revolutionary
aspect. The third estate, that of the burghers, was
knocking at the doors of the Polish Chamber, demanding equal
rights, and one of the principal parliamentary reforms consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
in equalizing the burghers with the Shlakhta in their
civil, though not in their political, prerogatives.</p>

<p>Two other questions affecting the inner life of Poland
claimed the attention of the legislators touched by the spirit
of reform: the agrarian and the Jewish question. The former
was discussed and brought to a solution, which could not be
other than favorable to the interests of the slaveholding
landowners. As for the Jewish question, it cropped up for a
moment at the tumultuous sessions of the Quadrennial Diet,
and like an evil spirit was banished into the farthest corner
of the Polish Chamber, into a special "deputation," or commission,
where it stuck forever, without finding a solution.</p>

<p>It would not be fair to ascribe this failure altogether to the
conservative trend of mind of the rejuvenators of Poland.
There was an additional factor that stood in the way of radical
reforms. Over the head of Poland hung the unsheathed sword
of Russia, and Russia was averse to the inner regeneration of
the country, which, having undergone one partition, was expected
to furnish a second and a third dish for the table of the
Great Powers. The Quadrennial Diet was a protest against
the oppressive patronage of Russia, which was personified by
her Resident in Warsaw, and had for its main purpose the
preparation of the country for the inevitable struggle with her
powerful neighbor. The "estates in Parliament assembled"
had to think of reorganizing the army and filling the war chest
rather than of carrying out internal reforms.</p>

<p>But outside the walls of the Chamber the current of public
opinion was whirling and foaming. Side by side with the legislative
assembly, a literary parliament was holding its deliberations,
the famous pamphlet "literature of the Quadrennial
Diet," reflecting the liberal currents of the eighteenth century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
The "Kollontay smithy"<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> alone, which was, so to speak, the
publishing house of the reformers, flooded the country with
pamphlets and leaflets touching upon all the questions connected
with the social reorganization of the Polish body politic.
Scores of pamphlets dealt partly or wholly with the Jewish
question. The discussions on the projects of "Jewish reform"
were conducted with intense passion, taking the place of parliamentary
debates.</p>

<p>The impulse to the literary discussion of the Jewish question
came from a pamphlet previously referred to, which had been
published by Butrymovich, a representative of the city of
Pinsk in the Diet, who stood out as the principal champion
of the renaissance of Polish Jewry. The publication consisted
of a reprint of the well-known pamphlet of "A Nameless Citizen,"
which had been circulated in two editions.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Butrymovich
supplied the pamphlet with a new title ("A Means whereby
to Transform the Polish Jews into Useful Citizens of the
Country"), and garnished it with comments of his own. In
this way the popular member of the Diet put the seal of his
approval upon the reform project, which was based on the
assumption that the Jews in their present state were detrimental
to the country, not because of their intrinsic make-up,
but on account of their training and mode of life, and that
their political and spiritual regeneration had to precede
their association with civil life. The proposed reforms reduced
themselves to the following measures: to promote useful pursuits
among the Jews, such as agriculture and handicrafts,
and to remove them from the obnoxious liquor traffic; to combat
their separateness by curtailing their Kahal autonomy;
to supersede the Yiddish dialect by the Polish language in
school and in business; to prohibit the wearing of a distinctive
costume and the importation of Hebrew books from abroad.
This reform project was supplemented by Butrymovich in one
particular: the Jews were not to be admitted to military service
in person, until enlightenment had transformed them
into patriots ready to serve their fatherland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet even this project, imbued though it was with the spirit
of patronage and compulsory assimilation, was deemed far
too liberal by many representatives of advanced Polish society.
One of the progressive Polish journals published "Reflections
Concerning the Jewish Reform Proposed by Butrymovich"
(December, 1798). The writer of the "Reflections" concedes
a certain amount of "political common sense" in the project,
but criticizes its author, because, "in his great zeal to preserve
the rights of man, he shows too much indulgence
towards the defects of the Jews." The anonymous journalist
in turn demands the complete annihilation of the Kahal and
limits the action of the Jewish communities to the exercise of a
purely congregational autonomy. He also considers it necessary
to restrict retail trade among the Jews in the cities, so that,
having been dislodged from commerce, they might be induced
to engage in handicrafts and agriculture.</p>

<p>Several magazine writers spoke far more harshly of the
Jews, and adopted a tone bordering on anti-Semitism. The
famous prelate Stashitz, the author of "A Warning to
Poland" (Warsaw, 1790), who enjoyed the reputation of being
a democrat, styles the Jews "a summer and winter locust for
the country," and voices the conviction that only in an environment
in which idleness is fostered could this "host of
parasites" find shelter, entirely forgetting that these "parasites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>"
had created the commerce of the country riven between
nobles and serfs.</p>

<p>The majority of these vilifiers agreed in one point, that the
defects of the Jews could be cured only by "reforming" their
life from above. An ancient historic nation, which had for
centuries managed its own affairs, was represented as a kind
of riffraff, whose life could be easily recut after a new pattern.
To achieve this end, all that was necessary was to let
the Polish language take the place of Yiddish, to substitute
the official Polish school for the traditional Jewish school, the
magistracy for the Kahal, handicrafts and agriculture for
commerce. The authors of the various schemes disagreed
merely as to the extent to which the radical and compulsory
character of these reforms should be pursued. Some suggested
abolishing altogether the communal autonomy of the Jews
(Kollontay); others would merely confine it to definite functions,
and place the Kahal under the supervision of the
Government (Butrymovich and others). Still others proposed
to shave off the Jews' beards and earlocks, to burn the Talmud,
and reduce the number of Jewish religious festivals.
Others again were content with prohibiting the traditional
Jewish costume and shutting down the Jewish printing-presses,
proposing at the same time "to encourage the translation of
Jewish religious literature into the Polish language." The plan
of limiting the number of Jewish marriages after the Austro-Prussian
model, by requiring a special permit of the police
and a certificate testifying to the ability of the candidate to provide
for his family and to his compliance with certain standards
of general education, appealed to all the reformers. Several
writers injected into the discussion of the Jewish question
the specific problem of the Neo-Christians, the converts from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
among the Frankist sect, who, having been merged with the
Polish gentry and burgher class, were yet treated by them as
strangers, and stood aloof equally from Christian and Jewish
society. The majority of Polish writers endorsed the contemptuous
attitude of Polish society towards these converts,
who in point of fact fostered their old sectarian leanings, traveled
abroad to do homage to Frank, and supplied him with
money.</p>

<p>In the babel of voices condemning the entire Jewish population
of the country and dooming it to a radical "refitting"
by means of police measures, only one solitary Jewish voice
made itself heard. Hirsch Yosefovich (son of Joseph), a rabbi
of Khelm, published a pamphlet in Polish, under the title
"Reflections Concerning the Plan of Transforming the Polish
Jews into Useful Citizens of the Country." While giving
Butrymovich full credit as an enlightened well-wisher of the
Jews, the Rabbi expresses his amazement that even cultured
men indulge in a wholesale condemnation of the Jewish people,
and charge the misdeeds of certain individuals among them
to the account of the whole nation, which is endowed with so
many virtues, and is of benefit to the country in so many respects.
The author emphatically protests against the proposed
abolition of the Kahals and against outside interference in the
religious affairs of the Jews, in a word, against the projects
tending to assimilate the Jews with the Poles, which assimilation
"was bound to result in the complete destruction of
Judaism." As an Orthodox rabbi he refuses to budge an inch,
even in the matter of a change in dress, slyly observing that
once the Jews are put in the category of malefactors, it
seems preferable to allow them to retain their traditional
garb, so as to mark them off from the Christians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>At that time Warsaw evidently did not yet possess the type
of cultured Mendelssohnians&mdash;they appeared in that city
shortly thereafter, under the Prussian <i>régime</i>&mdash;who might have
been in a position to engage in a literary discussion of the proposed
reforms from the Jewish point of view. "Enlightenment"
was then the exclusive privilege of a small number
of Jews who, as agents or as purveyors of the Crown, came
into contact with the Court or the Government. The project
of one of these "advanced" Jews, the royal broker Abraham
Hirschovich (son of Hirsch), has been preserved in the archives.
In this project, which was submitted to King Stanislav
Augustus during the sessions of the Great Diet, the author
suggests some of the patent remedies of the Polish reformers:
to induce the Jews to engage in handicrafts and agriculture "in
the deserted steppes of the Ukraina" and to forbid early marriages.
With regard to the change in dress, he advises beginning
with the prohibition of luxurious articles of wear, such as
silk, satin, velvet, pearls, and diamonds, the chase after finery
having a ruinous effect on men of moderate means. Rabbis, in
the opinion of Hirschovich, ought to be appointed only in the
large cities, and not in the smaller towns, for the reason that in
these towns, which are generally owned by the squires, the
rabbis purchase their office from the latter, and then ruin their
congregations by all kinds of assessments. The Kahals should
be spared, except that the Government ought to maintain order
in them, since the Jews themselves, on account of their differences
of opinion, "cannot institute reasonable rules of conduct
for themselves." The whole plan reflects the spirit of flunkeyism,
ever obsequiously willing to yield to the powers that be in
the matter "of eradicating the prejudices and misconceptions
of an erring people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>During the year 1789 and the first half of 1790 the Jewish
question did not come up at the sessions of the Quadrennial
Diet. In the midst of the passionate debates raging around the
supremely important bills involving the whole future of the
body politic, the Diet remained deaf to the repeated reminders
of Butrymovich, who demanded the same urgency for the proposed
Jewish reform. Neither did the heated literary discussions
centering on the Jewish question prompt the popular
representatives to take it up more speedily. But at this juncture
ominous shouts from the street began to penetrate into the
Chamber of Deputies, and the Diet had to bestir itself.</p>

<p>The metropolitan mob had made up its mind to solve the
Jewish question after its own fashion. To the Christian
tradesmen and artisans of Warsaw the Jewish question was
primarily a matter of professional competition. During the
first two years of the Great Diet the old law which confined the
Jewish right of residence in Warsaw to temporary visits during
the brief sittings of the Diets, had automatically fallen into disuse.
The Diet having prolonged its powers for a number of
years, the Jews thought that they too had the right to prolong
their term of residence. Accordingly an ever-growing wave
of Jewish tradesmen and artisans in search of a livelihood began
to flow from the provinces into the busy commercial emporium,
and this new influx could not fail to affect the Christian middle
class, inasmuch as the new-comers diverted purchasers and
customers from the native tradesmen and artisans, who were
affiliated with the guilds and trade-unions.</p>

<p>The privileged burghers, who by that time were on the point
of being equalized with the Shlakhta in their rights, raised a cry
of indignation. In March, 1790, a crowd of incorporated artisans,
among them a particularly large number of tailors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
furriers, surrounded the town hall, and vowed to murder all
Jews, should the magistracy refuse to expel them from Warsaw.
John Dekert, a well-known champion of the burgher class,
who was mayor at the time, immediately brought this demonstration
to the notice of the Diet, and the latter dispatched two
of its members to pacify the crowd. When asked by the
deputies about the motive of the gathering, the artisans declared
that the newly-arrived Jews made life intolerable by
wresting the last earnings from the Christian tailors and furriers.
The deputies promised to look into the matter. Accordingly,
on the following day, the Jewish artisans and street
venders were ordered out of the city, and only the merchants
who had stores or warehouses were permitted to remain.</p>

<p>Penniless and homeless, the exiled Jews could do nothing
but return surreptitiously to Warsaw soon afterwards. The
agitation among the Christian population commenced anew,
and on May 16, 1790, it vented itself in a riot. A certain Fox,
a member of the tailors' union, happened that day to meet a
Jewish tailor on the street who was carrying a piece of work in
his hand. He suddenly attacked him, and began to pull the
parcel out of his hands. The Jew tore himself away, and managed
to escape. The shouts of Fox attracted a crowd of Christian
artisans. Some one spread the rumor that the Jews had
killed a Christian tailor. At once the cry for vengeance went
up, and a riot began. The mob rushed into Tlomatzkie Street,
but was beaten off by the Jews, who had taken shelter behind a
fence. In the adjacent streets, however, "victory" perched
on the banner of the mob. They looted private residences as
well as stores and warehouses belonging to Jews, carrying off
whatever was valuable, and throwing the rest into wells. The
municipal guards, which came rushing along, were met by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
a hail of stones and bricks. Only when a detachment of soldiers
on foot and on horse appeared was the crowd dispersed and
order restored.</p>

<p>Stirred by these events, the Diet gave orders to investigate
the matter and bring the guilty to justice. Justice in the case
of the Christian malefactors amounted to the arrest of Fox and
the imprisonment of some of his accomplices. As for the Jews,
severe administrative measures were adopted: any peddler
or artisan found on the street with goods or orders was to be
conveyed to the marshal's guard-chamber, punished with rods,
and expelled. In such manner were Jewish artisans dealt with
at a time when the projects for reform were full of eloquent
phrases about the necessity of attracting the Jews to handicrafts
in particular and productive forms of labor in general.</p>

<p>The agitation in Warsaw led moreover to consequences of
a more serious nature. The Diet realized that further delay
in considering the Jewish question was impossible now that the
street had begun to solve it by its own simplified methods. On
June 22, 1790, the Diet appointed a "Commission for Jewish
Reform," which was composed of the deputies Butrymovich,
Yezierski, the Castellan of Lukov,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> and others. Yezierski, who
soon became the chairman of the Commission, was an advocate
of radical reforms, and as such came nearer than any of his colleagues
to a just estimate of the economic aspect of the Jewish
problem. In opposition to the current formula of "transforming
the Jews into useful citizens," he declared in the Diet that
in his opinion the Jews as it was were useful, because for a
long time they had constituted the only mercantile element in
Poland, and had rendered valuable services by exporting
abroad the products of the country and thus enriching it.
Hence the favorable financial position of the Jews would be
tantamount to a stronger position of the state finances and
an increase by many millions in the circulation of money. The
Commission, guided by Yezierski and Butrymovich, labored
assiduously. It examined a number of reform projects submitted
by Butrymovich, Chatzki, and others. Butrymovich's
project was an extract from his own publication referred to
previously. Similar in essence was the project of the well-known
historian and publicist Thaddeus Chatzki, the guiding
spirit of the finance committee of the Quadrennial Diet.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>In the beginning of 1791 the Commission of the Diet finished
its labors on the Jewish reform project, and submitted it to the
Diet for consideration. The project of the Commission, the
text of which has not come down to us, was doubtless based on
the proposals of Butrymovich and Chatzki. The Diet, completely
absorbed in arranging for the promulgation of the Constitution
of the third of May, was not in a position to busy
itself with the Jewish question. Only after the Constitution
had been promulgated in the session of May 24 was the Jewish
reform project brought up again by Butrymovich, who
claimed urgency for it. But at that juncture there arose
another member of the Jewish Commission, by the name of
Kholonyevski, a deputy from Bratzlav in Podolia, and announced
that he considered the project of the Commission,
with its extension of the commercial rights of the Jews, prejudicial
to the interests of Little Poland, and therefore moved to
recommend his own proposals to the attention of the House.
The Diet was glad of an excuse for postponing the consideration
of this vexatious problem. Soon afterwards, in June, the
Diet was adjourned, and it did not reassemble until September,
1791.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way the <i>magna charta</i> of Polish liberty&mdash;the Constitution
of May 3, 1791&mdash;was promulgated without modifying
in the slightest degree the status of the Jews. True, the new
Constitution did not in any way alter the former caste system
of the Polish Republic itself&mdash;the feudalism of the nobility,
the servitude of the peasantry, and the privileges of the gentry.
Nevertheless it conferred civil equality on the burgher class,
and placed the representative institutions on a somewhat more
democratic basis. Only the Jew, the cinderella of the realm,
was completely cut off in this last will of dying Poland.</p>

<p>The sessions of the Diet, which were renewed in the fall of
1791, were surrounded by a particularly disquieting political
atmosphere. The opponents of the new Constitution fomented
an agitation in the country. Civil strife and war with Russia
were imminent. Nevertheless the indefatigable Butrymovich
had the courage to remind the Diet once again of the necessity
of extending the protection of the Government to "the unfortunate
nationality which is not in a position to effect its own
rescue, and is not even aware of the direction in which the betterment
of its lot may be found." He demanded that the Commission
revise the project formerly elaborated by it, with a
view to submitting it anew to the House, with such amendments
as were "called forth by present-day circumstances."
Butrymovich was warmly seconded by Yezierski, who in the
same session (December 30) voiced the above-mentioned
"radical" idea, that in his opinion the Jews were even now
"useful citizens," and not merely likely to be "useful" in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
future. The Diet adopted the motion, and the Commission
once more resumed its labors.</p>

<p>The results of these labors were minimal. After protracted
deliberations the Commission arrived at the following conclusion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In order to improve the status of the Jewish population, it is
necessary to regulate its mode of life. Such regulation is impossible
unless that population is relieved from its Kahal indebtedness,
which relief cannot be brought about until the finance committee
has taken up the question of liquidation.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p></div>

<p>The Commission accordingly felt that, before taking up the
projected reforms, the Government should first point out ways
and means of liquidating the Kahal debts. The resolution of
the Commission was cheerfully passed in a plenary session of
the Diet. A burden had been lifted from its shoulders. There
was no more need of bothering about "Jewish reform" and
"equality." It was enough to instruct the local courts to fix
the extent of the Kahal debts and authorize the finance committee
to wipe them off with moneys taken from the available
Kahal funds or other special sources. Thus it came about
that, under the pretext of liquidating Jewish debts, "Jewish
reform" itself was liquidated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>Having been passed over by the Constitution of May 3, the
Jews, if we are to believe the accounts of several contemporaries,
made an attempt to influence the Government and the
Diet through the instrumentality of King Stanislav Augustus,
approaching the latter with the help of their connections at
court. Jewish public leaders are said to have assembled in
secret and elected three delegates, who were to enter into
negotiations with the King looking to the amelioration of the
condition of the Jews. The three delegates carried out their
mandate, towards the end of 1791 and the beginning of 1792,
with the help of the Royal Secretary Piatoli as their go-between.
Shortly thereafter they were received by the King in special
audience, with great solemnity, the King, as the story has it,
being seated on his throne during the reception. The Jews
pleaded for civil rights as well as for the right of acquiring
lands and houses in the cities, the preservation of their communal
autonomy, and exemption from the jurisdiction of the
magistracies. The story goes that the Jewish delegates held
out the promise of a gift of twenty million gulden to pay the
royal debts. Several leaders of the Diet, among them Kollontay,
a radical, were initiated into the secret. The King, according
to this report, endeavored to push the Jewish reform project
through the Jewish Commission and the Diet, but failed in
his efforts. The problem of ages could not be disposed of at
this anxious hour when the angel of death was hovering over
Poland, while the unfortunate land was exhausting its strength
in a final dash for inner regeneration and outer independence.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">3. The Last Two Partitions and Berek Yoselovich</span></p>

<p>The death struggle of Poland was approaching. The opponents
of the May Constitution among the conservative elements
of the country joined hands with the Russian Government,
which in its own sphere of influence had always been a
baneful stumbling-block in the path of progress. The result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
was the formation of the Confederacy of Targovitza<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and the
outbreak of civil war (summer, 1792). Though severed from
political life, the Jews nevertheless showed sympathy here and
there with the men that fought for the new Constitution. The
Jewish tailors of Vilna undertook to furnish gratis two hundred
uniforms for the army of liberty. The communities of
Sokhachev and Pulavy contributed their mite towards the
patriotic funds. The Jews of Berdychev took part in the deputation
of the local merchants which went to meet Joseph Poniatovski,
the commander-in-chief of the Polish army, and presented
him with new instruments for the regimental music
bands. On many an occasion the Jewish communities of Volhynia
and Podolia were the victims of enforced requisitions
from both belligerent armies. The community of Ostrog had
to undergo the bombardment of the city by the Russian army
in July, 1792.</p>

<p>The year 1793 saw the second partition of Poland, between
Russia and Prussia. Russia annexed Volhynia, with a part of
the province of Kiev, Podolia, and the region of Minsk. Prussia,
in turn, acquired the other part of Great Poland (Kalish,
Plotzk,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> etc.), with Dantzic and Thorn. Once more an enormous
territory, with hundreds of thousands of Jews, was cut
off from Poland. The unfortunate nation, seized with a
paroxysm of pain at this new amputation, burst forth against
its torturers. The Revolution of 1794 took its course.</p>

<p>At the head of the uprising stood Kosciuszko.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Having been
reared in the atmosphere of two great revolutions&mdash;the American
and the French&mdash;he had a loftier conception of civic and
political liberty than the liberalizing host of the Polish
Shlakhta. He was aware that no free country could exist
without first abolishing the serfdom of the peasants and the
inequality of the citizens. Even in the heat of his struggle
for the salvation of the fatherland, the Polish leader occasionally
gave proof of his democratic tendencies, and the
oppressed classes could not but feel that this revolution was
more than merely an affair of the Shlakhta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>The enthusiasm for liberty communicated itself to several
sections of Polish Jewry. It was manifested during the prolonged
Russo-Prussian siege of Warsaw in the summer and
autumn of 1794, when the whole population was called to arms
to defend the capital. The very same Jews who but a little
while ago had been attacked on the streets of Warsaw by the
burghers and artisans, and were mercilessly driven from the
city by order of the administration, now, in the moment of
danger, fought in the trenches shoulder to shoulder with their
persecutors, digging ditches and throwing up earthworks.
Frequently at an alarm signal the volunteers would rush out
to fight back the besiegers. Amidst the whistling of bullets
and bursting of shells they repulsed the enemies' attacks side
by side with the other Varsovians, furnishing their quota in
wounded and killed, and yet keeping up their courage. Among
the Jews defending Warsaw the plan was conceived of forming
a separate Jewish legion to fight for the country. At the head
of this patriotic group stood Berek Yoselovich.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Born about 1765 in the little town of Kretingen,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Berek had
traversed the thorny path that led a poor Jewish boy from
the Jewish religious school (heder) to the post of a pan's
agent. He entered the employ of a high noble, the Bishop of
Vilna, by the name of Masalski, and was thereby launched upon
his remarkable career. Masalski often went abroad, especially
to Paris, and always took his Jewish agent with
him. During these travels young Berek early acquired the
French language, and observed the life of the Parisian
salons in which the master moved. The plain Polish Jew
perceived a new world, and he could not help scenting the
new tendencies floating about in the air of the world's capital
on the eve of the great Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>During the years of the Quadrennial Diet Berek, who had
given up his position with Masalski, and had married in the
meantime, lived in Praga, a suburb of Warsaw. In the atmosphere
of patriotic excitement, the vague impressions which his
contact with the Polish nobility and his foreign travels had left
upon his mind came to maturity. The heroic figure of Kosciuszko
and the siege of Warsaw gave these vague sensations a
concrete form. He realized that it was his immediate duty to
fight for the freedom of the country, for the salvation of the
capital, where Poles and Jews were equally shut off and cooped
up by the hand of the enemy. Now was the time to prove that
even the stepchildren of the nation knew how to fight in the
ranks of her sons, and that they deserved a better lot.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in September, 1794, at the very height of the
siege, Berek Yoselovich, conjointly with Joseph Aronovich
(son of Aaron), a fellow-Jew of like mind, applied to Kosciuszko,
the commander-in-chief, for permission to form a
special regiment of light cavalry consisting of Jewish volunteers.
Kosciuszko immediately complied with their request,
and announced it joyfully in a special army order, dated September
17, extolling the patriotic zeal of the originators of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
plan, "who remember the land in which they were born, and
know that its liberation will bestow upon them [the Jews] the
same advantages as upon the others." Berek was appointed
commander of the Jewish regiment. An appeal was issued calling
for recruits and for contributions towards their equipment.
Berek's appeal to his coreligionists was published in the official
"Gazette" of Warsaw on October 1. It was written in
Polish, though couched in the solemn phraseology of the
Bible:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Listen, ye sons of the tribes of Israel, all ye in whose heart is
implanted the image of God Almighty, all that are willing to help
in the struggle for the fatherland.... Know ye that now the
time hath come to consecrate to this all our strength.... Truly,
there are many mighty nobles, children of the Shlakhta, and
many great minds who are ready to lay down their lives!...
Why then should we who are persecuted not take to arms, seeing
that we are the most oppressed people in the world!... Why
should we not labor to obtain our freedom which has been promised
us just as firmly and sincerely as it has been to others? But
first we must show that we are worthy of it.... I have had the
happiness of being placed at the head of the regiment by my
superiors. Awake then, and help to rescue oppressed Poland.
Faithful brethren, let us fight for our country as long as a drop
of blood is left in us! Though we ourselves may not live to see
this [our freedom], at least our children will live in tranquillity
and freedom, and will not roam about like wild beasts. Awake then
like lions and leopards!</p></div>

<p>Berek's language is crude and naïve, and so is his political
reasoning. While calling upon the Jews to join "the mighty
nobles" in fighting for liberty, he evidently overlooked the fact
that the liberty of the Jews was far from being secured by
the liberty of the nobles, among whom men with the humanitarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
tendencies of a Kosciuszko were few and far between.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
Berek, however, found solace in the hope that the participation
of the Jews in the struggle for Polish independence would
bring about a change. He lived at a time when the Jews of
Western Europe were eager to display their patriotic sentiments
and civic virtues. Before his mind's eye there probably
floated the figures of Jews who, since 1789, had served in the
<i>garde nationale</i> of Paris.</p>

<p>Berek's enthusiasm succeeded in attracting many volunteers.
In a short time a regiment of five hundred men was made up.
The Jewish legion, which was hastily equipped with the scanty
means supplied by the revolutionary Government and by voluntary
contributions, had the checkered appearance of militia.
Yet the consciousness of military duty was keen in these men,
many of whom carried arms for the first time in their lives.
The Jewish regiment displayed its dauntless and self-sacrificing
spirit on that fatal November fourth, the day of the terrible
onslaught upon Praga by the Russian troops under Suvarov.
Among the fifteen thousand Poles who lost their lives in the
intrenchments of Praga, in the streets of Warsaw, or in the
waves of the Vistula, was also the regiment of Berek Yoselovich.
The bulk of the regiment met its fate at the fortifications,
being killed by Russian shells or bayonets. Berek himself
survived, and fled abroad with General Zayonchek, Kosciuszko's
comrade in arms, Kosciuszko himself having been
made a Russian prisoner somewhat earlier. Berek was at
first arrested in Austria, but he managed to escape and reach
France, where he found himself among the Polish revolutionary
refugees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>The third partition of Poland, which took place in 1795,
transferred to Russia the backbone of the former Jewry of
Poland, the dense masses of Lithuania, the provinces of Vilna
and Grodno. Prussia absorbed the remainder of Great Poland,
including Warsaw and Mazovia,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> as well as the region of Bialystok.
Austria rounded off her possessions in Little Poland by
adding the provinces of Cracow and Lublin. Henceforward
the fortunes of the Polish Jews are identical with those of
their brethren in these three countries, and exhibit a "tricolored"
appearance&mdash;Austro-Prusso-Russian.</p>

<p>However, even the third partition of Poland was not final as
far as the political distribution of territory is concerned. For
a short interval the ghost of a semi-independent Poland dances
fitfully about. Twelve years after the third partition,
Napoleon I., in juggling with the political map of Europe and
calling mushroom states into being, snatched the province of
Great Poland from the grasp of Prussia, and turned it into the
Duchy of Warsaw, a small Polish commonwealth under the
rule of the Saxon King Frederick Augustus III., a grandson of
Augustus II., the last Polish King of the Saxon dynasty. This
took place in 1807, after the crushing blow which Prussia
had received at the hands of Napoleon and after the conclusion
of the Peace of Tilsit. Two years later, in 1809, when
Napoleon had shattered Austria, he tore off a section of
her Polish dominions, and joined them to the Duchy of
Warsaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span><span class="smcap">4. The Duchy of Warsaw and the Reaction under
Napoleon</span></p>

<p>Warsaw, having been cleared of the Prussians, once more
became, after an interval of twelve years, the capital of a
separate Polish state, resuscitated under the patronage of
Napoleon. The Duchy of Warsaw, which was made up of
the ten "departments," or districts, of Great and Little
Poland, received from her French master a fairly liberal
Constitution, two legislative chambers (the Diet and the
Senate), and the "Code of Napoleon," which had just been
introduced in France. The fundamental laws proclaimed
the equality of all citizens; serfdom was abolished, and all
class privileges were abrogated.</p>

<p>The Jews too cherished hopes for a better future. The
nimbus of Napoleon as the originator of the "Jewish Parliament"
and the Parisian Synhedrion, had not yet faded from
the minds of the Jews, and they cherished the hope that the
Emperor would extend his protection to the Polish Jews as
well, but they were grievously disappointed.</p>

<p>The first year of the Duchy of Warsaw (1807-1808) coincided
with a critical turn in Napoleon's own policy towards the
Jews of France. The "Great Synhedrion" was disbanded,
and its disbandment was followed by the humiliating Imperial
decree of March 17, 1808, which for a decade checked in almost
the entire French Empire the operation of the law providing
for Jewish emancipation. This reactionary step was grist
to the mill of those sinister forces in Poland which had learned
nothing from the violent upheavals their country had undergone,
and even now were not able to reconcile themselves to the
idea of granting equality to the unloved tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>In the spring of 1808 the Government of the Duchy was
forced to pay attention to the Jewish question, in consequence
of a petition for civil rights presented by the Jews, and in
connection with the impending elections to the Diet. The
Council of Ministers, which had already been informed of
Napoleon's decree, clutched at it as an anchor of salvation.
A report was submitted to Duke Frederick Augustus, in
which it was pointed out that "a somber future would be in
store for the Duchy if the Israelitish nation, which is to be
found here in vast numbers, were suddenly to be allowed to
enjoy civil rights," the reason being that this people "cherishes
a national spirit alien to the country," and engages in unproductive
occupations. The Council of Ministers pointed to
Napoleon's decree suspending the Jewish question for a time
as a convenient means of evading the clause of the Constitution
granting equal rights to all citizens.</p>

<p>To make sure of Napoleon's approval in this matter, the
Government of Warsaw conducted negotiations with its agents
in France and with the French minister Champagny, who was
a Jew-hater. Napoleon's sympathetic attitude towards this
anti-Jewish policy having been ascertained, the Duke promulgated
on October 17, 1808, a decree to the following effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inhabitants of our Varsovian Duchy <i>professing the Mosaic
religion</i> shall be barred for ten years from enjoying the political
rights they were about to receive, in the hope that during this
interval they may eradicate their distinguishing characteristics,
which mark them off so strongly from the rest of the population.
The foregoing decision, however, will not prevent us from allowing
individual members of that persuasion to enjoy political rights
even before the expiration of said term, provided they will prove
themselves worthy of our high favor, and will comply with the
conditions which will be set forth by us in a special edict concerning
the professors of the Mosaic religion.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way the Government of Warsaw in politely couched
terms, phrased after the modern French pattern, managed to
rob all the "professors of the Mosaic religion" of the rights
of citizenship which the Constitution had granted them. It
is true that the decree uses the words "political rights," but
in reality the Jews were divested by it of their elementary civil
rights. In November, 1808, they were forbidden to acquire
patrimonial estates belonging to the Shlakhta. The humiliating
restrictions attaching to the right of domicile in Warsaw
were restored, and were embodied in a decree issued in 1809
which ordered the Jews to remove within six months from the
main streets of the capital, except a few individuals, such as
bankers, large merchants, physicians, and artists. There was
a general tendency to return to the anti-Jewish traditions of
the Old Polish and Prussian legislation.</p>

<p>The Jewish community became alarmed. By that time Warsaw
already possessed a goodly number of "advanced" Jews,
who had acquired the new culture of Berlin, and had divested
themselves of the distinguishing marks in dress and outward
appearance for which the Jews were penalized with the loss of
rights. Relying upon the second clause of the ducal decree,
which provided for the exceptional treatment of those who
shall have "eradicated their distinguishing characteristics,"
a group of seventeen Jews of this type made representations
to the Minister of Justice in January, 1809, to the effect
that, "having endeavored for a long time, by their moral conduct
and modern dress, to come into closer touch with the rest
of the population, they are now certain that they have ceased to
be unworthy of civil rights." To this flunkeyish petition the
Minister of Justice, Lubenski&mdash;one of the "constitutional"
ministers who managed to promote the interests of despotism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
under the cloak of liberalism&mdash;retorted with coarse sophistry,
that constitutional equality before the law did not yet make
a man a citizen, for only those could claim to be citizens who
were loyal to the sovereign, and looked upon this country as
their only fatherland. "Can those"&mdash;added Lubenski&mdash;"who
profess the laws of Moses look upon this country as their fatherland?
Do they not wish to return to the land of their fathers?... Do
they not regard themselves as a separate nation?...
The mere change of dress is not yet sufficient." The Polish
minister had, it would seem, made a thorough study of
Napoleon's catechism on the Jews.</p>

<p>Aside from the representatives of this sartorial culture, who
looked after their own personal advantage, there were among
the Jews of Warsaw followers of the Berlin "enlightenment,"
who considered it their duty to make a stand for the rights of
their people. On March 17, 1809, five representatives of the
Jewish community of Warsaw submitted a memorandum to
the ducal Senate, in which not only the note of entreaty but
also the undertone of indignation could be discerned.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thousands of <i>members of the Polish nation of the Mosaic persuasion</i>,
who, by virtue of having dwelt in this country for many
centuries, have acquired the same right to consider it their fatherland
as the other inhabitants, have hitherto, without any fault of
theirs, to the damage of society and as an insult to mankind, for
reasons that no one knows, been doomed to humiliation, and are
groaning under the load of daily oppressions.</p></div>

<p>Contrary to the enlightened spirit of the age and "the

<p>We carry a heavier burden of taxation than the other citizens.
We are robbed of the gladsome opportunity of acquiring a piece of
land, of building a little house, of founding a household, of erecting
a factory, of engaging in commerce unhampered, in a word, doing
that which God and nature hold out to man. In Warsaw
we are even ordered out of the main streets. And what shall we
say of those blessed liberties which citizens value most highly&mdash;the
right of electing their superiors and of being elected by their
compatriots, so as not to be as a dead body in the civic life of the
nation? Is the land in which our fathers, paying heavily for this
privilege, saw the light of the world, always to remain strange to
us? Gentlemen of the Senate, we lay before you the tears of the
fathers and of the children and of the coming generations. We
beg you to hasten the happy day when we may enter upon the enjoyment
of the rights and liberties with which Napoleon the Great
has endowed the inhabitants of this country, and which our beloved
country recognizes as the possession of her children.</p></div>

<p>To this petition of the Jews, who classed themselves as
"members of the Polish nation," and were ready to renounce
their own national characteristics, the Senate replied by presenting
the Duke with a heartless report, in which it was
pointed out that the Jews had brought upon themselves the
"curtailment of their rights" by their "dishonest pursuits"
and by "their mode of life, subversive of the welfare of society."
It was necessary first to reform the life of the Jews and to
appoint a committee to elaborate plans of reform. It may be
remarked parenthetically that a committee of this kind had
been in existence since the end of 1808, and had worked out a
"plan of reform" akin in spirit to the projects of the Quadrennial
Diet and the Parisian Synhedrion. But all these committees
were in reality nothing but a decent way of burying
the Jewish question.</p>

<p>At the very time when the Government of the Varsovian
Duchy rejected the Jewish appeal for equality, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
pretext that the Jews lacked patriotism, there lived and worked
in Warsaw a shining example of Polish patriotism, Berek
Yoselovich, the hero of the Revolution of 1794. After roaming
about for twelve years in Western Europe, where, having enlisted
in the ranks of the "Polish legions" of Domvrovski, he
took part in many Napoleonic wars, Berek returned home as
soon as the Duchy was established, and received an appointment
as commander of a detachment in the regular Polish army.
The dream of the old fighter had failed to come true. In vain
had his "Jewish regiment" filled the trenches of Praga with
their dead bodies. Twelve years later the brethren of those
who had sacrificed their lives for their fatherland had to beg
for the rights of citizenship. But Berek seems to have forgotten
his former ambition on behalf of his fellow-Jews, having
in the meantime become a professional soldier. It was solely
Polish patriotism and personal bravery that prompted the last
military exploits of his life. When, in the spring of 1809, war
broke out between the Duchy and the Austrians, Berek Yoselovich,
at the head of his regiment, rushed against the enemy's
cavalry near the town of Kotzk.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> He fell on May 5, after a
series of heroic deeds.</p>

<p>The papers lamented the loss of the hero. A representative
of the Polish aristocracy, the proud Stanislav Pototzki, devoted
a special discourse to his memory at a meeting of the "Society
of the Friends of Science" in Warsaw.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thou hast saddened&mdash;thus spoke the orator&mdash;the land of heroes,
thou valiant Colonel Berek, when unmeasured boldness drove thee
into the midst of the enemy.... Well doth the fatherland
remember also thy old wounds and thy former exploits, remember
eternally that thou wast the first to give thy people an example, an
example of rejuvenated heroism, and that thou hast resuscitated
the image of those men of valor over whom in days gone by wept
the daughters of Zion.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>The Polish nation remembered, and that for a short time
only, the one Berek; but the thousands of his oppressed
brethren were forgotten. The only way in which the gratitude
of the "fatherland" manifested itself was a special order
of the Duke granting permission to Berek's widow, who found
it difficult to live and bring up her children on her scanty
pension, to reside in the streets of Warsaw from which the
Jews were barred, and "to engage there in the sale of liquor."
Other civil privileges the Jews could not hope for, even by
way of exception.</p>

<p>This state of affairs could not very well inspire the Jewish
population with a great love for military service, although the
Jews had been graciously permitted to discharge it in person.
With few exceptions, the Jews preferred to pay an
additional tax rather than spill their blood for a country
which offered them obligations without rights. The decree of
January 29, 1812, legalized this substitution of personal military
service by a monetary ransom, the grand total of which
amounted to 700,000 gulden a year.</p>

<p>On the brink of destruction, during the war tempest of 1812,
the Duchy of Warsaw still found leisure to strike an economic
blow at the Jews. At the suggestion of Minister Lubenski, a
ducal decree was issued on September 30 forbidding the Jews,
after the lapse of two years, to sell liquor and keep taverns,
which meant, in other words, that tens of thousands of Jewish
families were to be deprived of their livelihood. Secretly the
Government justified this measure by the impending augmentation
of the territory of the Duchy and the restoration of Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Poland, where strict economic measures were necessary to keep
the returning Jewish population in bounds. But the confidence
reposed in the power of Napoleon was not justified. The
idol was overthrown. The Duchy of Warsaw, the pale specter
of an independent Poland, vanished into air, and the fate
of the country again lay in the hands of the three Powers
that had divided it, particularly Russia. The millions of Jews
in Russian Poland were well aware of what they had to expect
at the hands of their new rulers.

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
THE BEGINNINGS OF THE RUSSIAN RÉGIME</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">1. The Jewish Policy of Catherine II. (1772-1796)</span></p>

<p>The quarantine which Russia, prior to Catherine II., had
established for the "enemies of Christ," was broken through
in 1772 by the first partition of Poland. At one stroke the
number of Russian subjects was swelled by the huge Jewish
masses of White Russia. The Russian Empire was augmented
by a new province adjoining its central possessions, and together
with the new region and its variegated population it
acquired hundreds of thousands of subjects of the kind it had
hitherto ruthlessly driven beyond its borders.</p>

<p>What was to be done with the unwelcome heritage bequeathed
by Poland? The primitive policy of an Elizabeth
Petrovna might have dictated some barbarous measure,
such as the wholesale expulsion of the Jews from the newly-acquired
territory. But the statesmanlike intellect of a Catherine
could not, during the formulation of the liberal "Instructions,"<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
admit such barbarism, which moreover would have been
incompatible with the new pledges the Russian Government
had found it necessary to give to the heterogeneous population
of White Russia at the time of annexation. In the "Placard"
issued on this occasion by Count Chernyshev, the first Governor-General
of White Russia, all residents, "of whatever
birth and calling," were "solemnly assured by the sacred
name and word of the Empress," that their religious liberty
as well as their personal rights, and the privileges attaching
to property and estate, would remain inviolate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>This "assurance" included the Jews, though not without
qualification, as is shown by this passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the aforesaid solemn assurance of the free exercise of
religion and the inviolability of property for one and all, it follows
of itself that also the Jewish communities residing in the cities
and territories now incorporated into the Russian Empire will be
left in the enjoyment of all those liberties which they possess at
present, in accordance with the [Russian] law and [their own]
property. For the humaneness of her Imperial Majesty will not
allow her to exclude the Jews alone from the grace vouchsafed to
all and from the future prosperity under her beneficent rule, so
long as they on their part shall live in due obedience as faithful
subjects, and shall limit themselves to the pursuit of genuine trade
and commerce according to their callings.</p></div>

<p>To be sure, the Jews, in contradistinction to the rest of the
population, are promised the high Imperial favor on condition
of "due obedience." Yet the inviolability of their former
rights was solemnly guaranteed, and Russian politics had
henceforward to be guided by it.</p>

<p>Immediately on the annexation of the new province a general
census was ordered. According to the testimony of a contemporary,
the number of Jews in White Russia was found to
amount to over forty thousand families, about two hundred
thousand souls. An ukase of 1772 imposed upon them a
<i>per capita</i> tax of one rubel (50c.). The annexed territory
was divided into two Governments, those of Moghilev and Polotzk,
or, as it is called at present, Vitebsk. In the interest
of the regular collection of taxes, the administration from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the very beginning gave instructions "to have all Jews
affiliate with the Kahals and to institute such [Kahals] as the
governors may suggest or as necessity for them may arise."</p>

<p>The problems connected with the inner organization of the
Jews were of a more complicated character. Far-reaching
changes were taking place at that time in the provincial and
the social organization of the Russian Empire. In 1775 was
promulgated the "Regulation Concerning the Governments."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
In 1785 was issued the "Act Concerning Municipal Administration,"<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
and the authorities were confronted by an alternative:
either to place the Jews under the general laws, according
to the estate to which they belonged (in the cities the
mercantile class, the burghers, and the trade-unions), or, in
view of their peculiar conditions of life and the Kahal autonomy
inherited from Poland, allow them to retain their own institutions
as part of their communal and spiritual self-government.
It was a difficult problem, and Russian legislation at first
wavered between these two ways of solving it, with the result
that matters became muddled. The interference of the local
administration and the old rivalry among the various estates
made confusion worse confounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>The ukase issued by the Senate in 1776 sanctioned the
existence of the Kahal, regarding it primarily as a fiscal and
legislative institution, which the Russian administration found
convenient for its purposes. At the instance of Governor-General
Chernyshev, the Jews of White Russia were set apart as
a separate tax-unit and as an estate of their own. They were
to be entered on special registers in the towns, townlets, villages,
and hamlets, wherever a census was taken. The instructions
read that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>in order that their taxes may be more regularly remitted to the
exchequer, Kahals shall be established in which they [the Jews]
shall all be enrolled, so that every one of the "Zhyds,"<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> whenever
he shall desire to travel somewhere on business, or to live and
settle in one place or another, or to take anything on lease, shall
receive a passport from the Kahal. The same Kahal shall pay
the head-tax, and turn it over to the provincial exchequer.</p></div>

<p>Thus, as regards the payment of taxes, and the rights not
only of transit but also of business, every Jew was placed in
the same position of dependence on his Kahal as under the old
Polish <i>régime</i>. At the same time the Kahal was endowed with
certain judicial functions. District and Government Kahals,
the latter conceived as courts of appeal, were established for
cases between Jews, each of these Kahals being assigned a
definite number of elective judges. Only lawsuits between
Jews and non-Jews were to be brought before the general
magistracy courts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>But a few years later the Government was shaken in its
resolve to uphold the former Kahal organization to its full
extent. In 1782 an inquiry was addressed by the Senate to Passek,
the new Governor-General of White Russia, as to the legality
of establishing special Jewish law courts. A year later the
Government took a decided step in the opposite direction. It
recognized the rights of Jews registered in the merchant class
to participation in the general city government, to elect and to
be elected on equal terms with the Christian members of the
magistracies, town councils, and municipal courts. The realization
of this reform was greatly hampered by the opposition of
the Christian merchants and burghers, who hated the Jews,
and could not reconcile themselves to the municipal equality
of their competitors. Having accustomed themselves to look
down upon the Jews as citizens of an inferior grade, the
Christian city officials assumed a hostile attitude towards
their Jewish colleagues who had been elected to public posts,
and by electioneering methods managed to reduce their numbers
in the city corporations to a minimum. The interests of
the Jews were bound to suffer, particularly as far as the
administration of justice was concerned.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the administration itself began to oppress
them. The liberal Chernyshev was superseded by the anti-Jewish
Passek, who did his utmost to restrict the Jews in
their economic activities, to the obvious advantage of their
competitors in the ranks of the Shlakhta and the Christian
merchants.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Jews&mdash;a contemporary who had himself been affected by
these measures informs us&mdash;were driven from their breweries and
distilleries, their toll-houses, hostelries, etc., which formed their
principal means of livelihood. Thousands of families were reduced
to beggary. In addition, new restrictions were introduced affecting
business, handicrafts, and so forth.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>The acuteness of the economic and social crisis among the
Jews of White Russia during that period of transition is
evidenced by the petition which their delegates submitted in
1784 to Catherine II.</p>

<p>The petition, consisting of six points, is permeated with a
profound feeling of despair. The Jews complain that the
administration has deprived them completely of their main
sources of income: distilling, brewing, and liquor-selling in
the cities. They furthermore point out that Governor-General
Passek has forbidden the landed proprietors to lease the inns
on their estates to Jews, and that in consequence a large
number of families, who depended for their livelihood on some
form of liquor-selling and innkeeping, had been brought to the
verge of ruin. They also contend that the Jews had not reaped
the expected benefits from the equal municipal rights conferred
upon them, for where the Jews are in a minority not a single
Jewish candidate is admitted to a municipal or judicial office,
"so that whenever a Jew goes to law against a Christian,
he is liable to become the victim of a partial verdict, because
there is no coreligionist to intercede on his behalf in the
courts, and he is not familiar with the Russian language."
Their further grievances relate to the arbitrariness of the
landed proprietors, who "from sheer caprice, contrary to
agreement," impose an excessive land rent on the Jews who
have erected houses on their property, so that they are forced
to abandon their houses. Sometimes houses are requisitioned
for Government purposes, or are torn down "to be rebuilt according
to [new official street] plans," without the slightest
compensation to their owners. The magistracies, on the other
hand, often compel the Jews who are domiciled in the townlets
and villages, but are enrolled among the merchants or burghers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
of some city, to build houses in that city, "whereby the Jews
are liable to be reduced to extreme poverty, inasmuch as by
spending their capital on building they have no capital wherewith
to run their business."</p>

<p>The petition was received by the Empress, who, in forwarding
it, in 1785, to the Senate for consideration, deemed it
necessary to indicate her general attitude in the following
"resolution":</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Her Majesty desires to have it pointed out that, inasmuch as the
aforesaid persons of the Jewish religion have been placed by the
ordinances of her Majesty in the same position as the others,
it is necessary in every case to observe the rule that everyone is
entitled to the advantages and rights appertaining to his calling or
estate, without distinction of religion or nationality.</p></div>

<p>The Senate had to comply with the comprehensive and
liberal-minded injunction of the Empress in endeavoring to
solve the burning problems affecting Jewish life. The solution
finally arrived at was a feeble compromise between the
economic, national, and class interests which were contradictory
to one another. In its ukase of May 7, 1786, the Senate
partly fulfilled and partly declined the demands of the White
Russian Jews. The right of pursuing freely the liquor trade
in the cities was refused, in view of the fact that, according
to the new law, liquor-dealing constituted a monopoly of the
city administration. On the other hand, the Jews were accorded
the rights of participating on equal terms with non-Jews
in the public bids for the lease of the pothouses. Passek's
rescript forbidding the landowners to let out distilleries
and inns to the Jews was declared an illegal infringement of
the rights of the landowners, and therefore ordered to be
countermanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>The complicated question as to the compatibility of municipal
self-government with Jewish Kahal autonomy was
equally solved by a compromise. With respect to the magistracies,
town councils, boards of aldermen, and law courts, the
Jews were accorded proportionate representation in agreement
with the general provisions of the new city government.
The common municipal courts, in which Jews were to be
represented by elective jurymen of their own, were to handle
both civil and criminal cases, not only between persons of
different denominations, but also between Jew and Jew. The
District and Government Kahals were to deal with spiritual
affairs only. They were also to be charged with the distribution
of the state and communal taxes in the various Jewish communities.</p>

<p>As for the complaints of the Jews against the oppression
of the administration as well as of the magistracies
and the landowners, all the Senate did was to point to the
principle by which all the members of a given estate are
equally vouchsafed the rights appertaining to it. The Senate
even went so far as to bar all references to the former Polish
laws with their discriminations against the Jews, "for, inasmuch
as they [the Jews] are enrolled among the merchants and
burghers on the same terms, and pay equal taxes to the exchequer,
they ought in all circumstances to be given the same
protection and satisfaction as the other subjects." Yet in
the very same ukase the Senate refuses to grant the petition
of several White Russian Jews who asked to be enrolled in the
merchant corporation of Riga, basing its refusal on the absence
of a special Imperial permit allowing the Jews to register as
merchants outside of White Russian territory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we have the first application of the ignominious principle
of subsequent Russian legislation, that everything is forbidden
to Jews unless permitted by special law. The ukase of
1786, with all its liberal phrases about the equality of the members
of all classes irrespective of religion, imperceptibly instituted
a Pale of Settlement by attaching the Jews to definite
localities, which had been wrested from Poland, and refusing
them the right of residence in other parts of Russia. The implied
criticism of the Senate, directed against "the former
Polish laws with their discriminations against the Jews,"
could with far greater justice be leveled in much sharper
form against the Russian legislation which subsequently curtailed
the Jewish right of transit and commerce to an extent
undreamt-of even by the fiercest anti-Jewish restrictionists of
Poland.</p>

<p>While in the first two decades after the occupation of White
Russia the Russian Government observed a comparatively
liberal, at least a well-intentioned, attitude towards the Jewish
question, in later years it openly embarked upon a policy of
exceptional laws and restrictions. The general reactionary
tendency, which was partly the result of the "ominous" successes
of the great French Revolution, and gained the upper
hand in Russia towards the end of Catherine's reign, was mirrored
also in the position of the Jews. At that juncture the
second and third partitions of Poland (1793, 1795) were
effected, and hundreds of thousands of Jews from Lithuania,
Volhynia, and Podolia were added to the numbers of Russian
subjects. The country, which barely a generation before had
not tolerated a single Jew within its borders, now included
a territory more densely populated by Jews than any other.
Some means of reconciliation had to be found between these
historic opposites, the traditional anti-Jewish policy of Russia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
on the one hand, and the presence of millions of Jews within
its dominions, on the other, and such means were found in
that system of Jewish rightlessness which since that time has
become one of the principal characteristics of the political
genius of Russian autocracy. The ancient Muscovite policy
peeped out with ever greater boldness from beneath the European
mask of St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>On the very eve of the second partition of Poland, when the
Russian Government merely anticipated an influx of Jews, it
had a fatal gift in store for them: the law of the Pale of Settlement,
which was to create within the monarchy of peasant
serfs a special class of territorially restricted city serfs. It
should be added that the impulse towards the creation of this
disability did not come from above but from below, from the
influential Christian middle class, which, fearing free competition,
began to shout for protection.</p>

<p>The first step in robbing the Jews of Russia of their freedom
of movement was made a few years after the occupation of
White Russia. The Jewish merchants of the White Russian
Governments Moghilev and Polotzk (or, as the latter is called
at present, Vitebsk) which border on the Great Russian Governments
of Smolensk and Moscow, began to visit the two cities
of the same name and carry on trade, wholesale and retail, in
imported dry goods. They did a good business, for the Jewish
merchants sold goods of a higher quality at a lower figure than
their Christian competitors. This set the merchants of Moscow
agog, and in February, 1790, they lodged a complaint with
the commander-in-chief of Moscow against the Jews who sell
"foreign goods by lowering the current prices, and thereby
inflict very considerable damage upon the local trade." The
complainants point to the ancient tradition of the Muscovite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Empire excluding the Jews from its borders, and assure the
authorities that Jewish rivalry will throw the trade of Moscow
into complete "disorder," and bring the Russian merchants
to the verge of ruin.</p>

<p>The petition, which at bottom was directed not alone against
the Jews, but also against the interests of the Russian consumer,
who was exploited by the "real Russian" trade monopolists,
found a sympathetic echo in Government circles. Accordingly,
in the autumn of the same year, the Council of State,
after considering the counter-petition of the Jews asking to be
enrolled in the merchant corporations of Smolensk and Moscow,
rendered the decision that it did not deem it expedient to
grant the Jews the right of free commerce in the inner Russian
provinces, because "their admission to it is not found to
be of any benefit." A year later this verdict was reaffirmed
by an Imperial ukase issued on December 23, 1791, to the effect
that "the Jews have no right to enroll in the merchant corporations
in the inner Russian cities or ports of entry, and are permitted
to enjoy only the rights of townsmen and burghers of
White Russia." To mitigate the severity of this measure the
ukase "deemed it right to extend the said privilege beyond
the White Russian Government, to the vice-royalty of Yekaterinoslav
and the region of Tavrida," <i>i. e.</i> the recently annexed
territory of New Russia, where the Government was anxious to
populate the lonely steppes.</p>

<p>In this way the first territorial ghetto, that of White Russia,
was established by law for the purpose of harboring the Jewish
population taken over from Poland. When again, two
years later, the second partition of Poland took place, the
northwestern ghetto was increased by the neighboring Government
of Minsk and the southwestern region&mdash;Volhynia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
with the greater part of the Kiev province and Podolia. The
ukase of June 23, 1794, conferred upon this enlarged Pale
of Settlement the sanction of the law. The Jews were granted
the right "to engage in the occupations of merchants and
burghers in the Governments of Minsk, Izyaslav (subsequently
Volhynia), Bratzlav (Podolia), Polotzk (now Vitebsk),
Moghilev, Kiev, Chernigov, Novgorod-Seversk, Yekaterinoslav,
as well as in the region of Tavrida." The ukase thus enlarges
the former pale of Jewish settlement by including Little Russia,
or the portion of the Ukraina which had been wrested from
Poland as far back as 1654,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>&mdash;in short, the territory from
which the Jews had been assiduously driven "beyond the
border" in the reign of the three Empresses preceding Catherine.
The organic connection of Little Russia with the portion
of the Ukraina on the right bank of the Dnieper which
had just been annexed from Poland, left the Russian Government
no other choice than to allow the Jews who had lived in
those parts from time immemorial to remain there. Even the
holy city of Kiev opened its gates to the Jews. The Dnieper
became thereby the central river of the Jewish Pale of Settlement.</p>

<p>The third partition of Poland, in 1795, added to the Dnieper
system that of the Niemen, the territory of Lithuania, consisting
of the Governments of Grodno and Vilna.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> This completed
the process of formation of the Pale of Settlement, at
the end of the eighteenth century. As for Eastern Russia, she
was just as vigilantly on her guard against the penetration of
the Jewish element as she had been in the time of the ancient
Muscovite Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The same ukase of 1794, which circumscribed the area of
the Jewish right of residence, laid down another fundamental
discrimination, that of taxation. The Jews, desirous of enrolling
themselves in the mercantile or burgher class in the
cities, were to pay the instituted taxes "doubly in comparison
with those imposed on the burghers and merchants of the
Christian religion." Those Jews who refused to remain in the
cities on these conditions were to leave the Russian Empire
after paying a fine in the form of a double tax for three years.
In this way the Government exacted from the Jews, for the
privilege of remaining in their former places without the right
of free transit in the Empire, taxes twice as large as those of
the Christian townspeople enjoying the liberty of transit. This
punitive tax did not relieve the Jews from the special military
assessment, which, by the ukases of 1794 and 1796, they had
to pay, like the Russian mercantile class in general, in exchange
for the personal discharge of military service.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that at the solicitation of Count
Zubov, the Governor-General of New Russia, the Karaites of the
Government of Tavrida were released from the double tax.
They were also granted permission to own estates, and were
in general given equal rights with the Christian population,
"on the understanding, however, that the community of Karaites
should not be entered by the Jews known by the name of
Rabins (Rabbanites), concerning whom the laws enacted by us
are to be rigidly enforced" (ukase of June 8, 1795). Here the
national-religious motive of the anti-Jewish legislation crops
out unmistakably. The handful of Karaites, who had for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
centuries lived apart from the Jewish nation and its spiritual
possessions, were declared to be more desirable citizens of the
monarchy than the genuine Jews, who were on the contrary to
be cowed by repressive measures.</p>

<p>A decided bent in favor of such measures is manifested in
the ukase of 1795, which prescribes that the Jews living in villages
be registered in the towns, and that "endeavors be made
to transfer them to the District towns, so that these people
may not wander about, but may rather engage in commerce
and promote manufactures and handicrafts, thereby furthering
their own interests as well as the interests of society."
The effect of this ukase was to sanction by law the long-established
arbitrary practice of the local authorities, who frequently
expelled the Jews from the villages, and sent them to
the towns under the pretext that Jews could be enrolled only
among the townsfolk. The expelled families, deprived of all
means of livelihood, were of course completely ruined, as the
mere bidding of the authorities did not suffice to enable them
"to engage in commerce and promote manufactures and handicrafts"
in the towns in which even the resident merchants and
artisans failed to make a living. The system of official tutelage
had the effect of fettering instead of developing the economic
activity of the Jews.</p>

<p>Experiments were now made to extend this tutelage to the
communal self-government of the Jews. In 1795 the edict was
repeated whereby the Government and District Kahals, in view
of the right, conferred upon the Jews, of participating in the
general city administration, in the magistracies and town councils,
were to be deprived of their social and judicial functions,
and not to be allowed "to concern themselves with any affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
except the ceremonies of religion and divine service."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> As a
matter of fact, the active participation of the Jews in the
municipalities, owing to the hostile attitude of the Christian
burghers, was extremely feeble. Yet, in the interest of the
exchequer, the Kahals were preserved for fiscal purposes, and,
on account of their financial usefulness, they continued to
function as the organs of Jewish communal autonomy, however
curtailed and disorganized the latter had now become.</p>

<p>In this wise the restrictive legislation against the Jews appears
firmly established towards the end of the reign of
Catherine II. A "Muscovite" wall had been raised between
the west and east of Russia, and even within the circumscribed
area of Jewish settlement the tendency was discernible to mark
off a still smaller area and, by forcing the Jews out of the
villages, to compress the Jewish masses in the towns and cities.
It fell to the lot of the successors of Catherine to consolidate
this tendency into law.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the historian cannot pass over in silence the
solitary "reform" of this period. In the legislative enactments
of the last decade of Catherine's reign the formerly current
contemptuous appellation "Zhyd" gave way to the name "Hebrew"
(Yevrey).<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The Russian Government found it impossible
to go beyond this verbal reform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span><span class="smcap">2. Jewish Legislative Schemes during the
Reign of Paul I.</span></p>

<p>The brief reign of Paul I. (1796-1801) added nothing of
moment to the Russian legislation concerning the Jews. The
law imposing a double tax was confirmed, and also the other
restrictions were left in force. The area of Jewish settlement
was increased by the newly-acquired Government of Courland,
on the outskirts of the Empire. In this Duchy, which was annexed
in 1795, there were several thousand Jewish inhabitants,
who had been "tolerated" as foreigners, after the German pattern,
and had only partly succeeded in forming a communal
organization. The question now arose as to the best way of
collecting the taxes from the itinerant chapmen who formed
the bulk of the Jewish population, and were enrolled neither
among the rural nor the urban estates, and were not even
affiliated with Jewish communities. The Russian Government
solved this question in 1799, by placing the Jews of Courland
in the same position as their coreligionists in the other western
Governments, and by granting them the right of enrolling
themselves among the mercantile or burgher estates, as well
as establishing their own Kahals. In this case fiscal considerations
were responsible for the organization of the Jewish masses
in the dominion of the German barons.</p>

<p>Having confined the Jewish population within the western
pale, the Government could not very well hamper its freedom
of transit within that pale, at least as far as moving from city
to city was concerned. This elementary right of free transit
was resorted to by many Jews of impoverished White Russia,
who began to emigrate into the Little Russian provinces, particularly
into the Government of Novgorod-Seversk, later the
Government of Poltava, which were more prosperous, and less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
crowded with Jews. The Government became aware of this
internal transmigration, and could not abstain from taking
it under its fatherly protection. Merchants were allowed to
move unhampered from White Russia into Little Russia.
Burghers, however, were permitted to emigrate only on the
conditions applying to all persons of the taxable estates&mdash;they
had to obtain certificates of dismissal (December, 1796).</p>

<p>Poor as was the reign of Paul in the field of concrete legislation
concerning the Jews, it was rich in preliminary endeavors
leading up to it. For his reign abounds in all kinds of projects
looking to the regulation of the status of the Jews on the basis
of official "investigations." In the outgoing years of the
eighteenth century (1797-1800) the Government offices were
feverishly busy in this direction. The Government was endeavoring
to familiarize itself with the state of the former Polish
provinces and particularly with the condition of the Jewish
population. The first step in this pursuit after knowledge
consisted in sending out a circular inquiry to the nobles and
the higher officials of the region under consideration. The
stimulus to this inquiry came in 1797, from a report submitted
on account of the famine which had been raging in the Government
of Minsk. Governor Karnyeyev of Minsk received
orders from St. Petersburg to gather the opinions of the local
Marshals, or leaders of the nobility, and on that basis supply
"an elucidation of the causes of the impoverished condition of
the peasants," with plans looking to their amelioration.</p>

<p>The shrewd device of questioning the landed aristocrats as to
the causes of the impoverishment of their peasant serfs bore
worthy fruit. Needless to say, the Polish magnates who
assembled in Minsk at the invitation of the Government did
not even for a moment think of reproaching themselves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
their own estate of slaveholders for the misery of the people
enthralled by them. Instead they preferred to put the blame
partly on external circumstances ("the changes and mutinies
in the province," bad crops, poor means of communication,
etc.), and partly on the Jews, "whom the owners [of the
villages] retain as arendars and tavern-keepers, contrary to the
orders of the authorities restricting their domicile to the
cities." The Jewish tavern-keepers in the country, so the
nobles allege, "lure the peasants into drunkenness," by selling
them spirits on trust, and thereby "render them unfit to
manage their affairs." In order to save the peasants, the Government
should insist "that the right of distilling be open
exclusively to the landowners, and be withheld from the Jews
as well as other arendars and tavern-keepers," and that in the
rural public houses "permission to sell hot wine [whiskey]
be given only to the squires." To put it in other words, the
peasants will thrive and be "fit to manage their affairs," if,
instead of Jewish alcohol, they will imbibe the aristocratic
alcohol of the landed proprietors.</p>

<p>One need not be a statesman to discover the underlying
motive of this "opinion" of the nobles, who were concerned
only about retaining the ancient alcohol monopoly which they
had enjoyed under the Polish <i>régime</i> ("the right of propination").
This, however, did not prevent the Governor of
Minsk from presenting the report of the nobility to the Tzar,
who on July 28, 1797, put down the following "resolution":<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
"Measures are to be taken, in accordance with the proposals of
the marshals of the nobility, to restrict the rights of the Jews
who ruin the peasants." At the same time the Senate called the
Governor's attention to Catherine's ukase ordering the transfer
of the Jews to the District towns, "so that these people
may not wander to and fro to the detriment of society." This
was tantamount to giving the authorities <i>carte blanche</i> in
expelling the Jews from the villages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>In 1798 came the turn of the nobility of the Southwest, of
Volhynia and Podolia, to state their wishes for the benefit of
the fatherland. The marshals of Podolia, who met at Kamenetz,
elaborated a much more comprehensive scheme of reform
than their compeers in Minsk. After expressing their gratitude
to the Tzar "for his Imperial benevolence in leaving us
the franchise of liquor-dealing," the nobles plead that "neither
the right of distilling nor that of selling liquor be let to Jews
or even to Christians," and that the nobles themselves be
granted the "liberty" of employing people in their "public
houses at their own discretion." After securing the monopoly
of intoxicating the people through their own bartenders, the
nobles propose to transform the bulk of the Jews into export
agents, to find foreign markets for the agrarian, <i>i. e.</i> manorial,
products, "whence commercial profits will accrue both to the
tillers of the soil (?!) and to the nobles." As for the other
Jews, part of them were to be retained by the landowners in
their public houses, and the rest were "to be forced to engage
in agriculture and handicrafts."</p>

<p>This brilliant prospect of becoming the tools of the nobles
for the disposal of rural products and the sale of manorial
alcohol had evidently little fascination for the Jews themselves.
Alarmed by these aristocratic designs, they held a consultation,
and even called a conference of delegates. The conference met
in Ostrog (Volhynia) in the summer of 1798, and decided to
collect a fund and send a deputation to St. Petersburg, to
lay before the Tzar the needs and wishes of the Jews of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Southwest, whom the Government had entirely forgotten to ask
how they themselves would like to have their affairs arranged.
Unfortunately the Governor-General of the Southwest, Count
Gudovich, "got wind" of these preparations. Far-sighted
statesman that he was, he immediately suspected "that this
collection [of money for the deputation] might merely serve
as a cover for some wicked Jewish design." He accordingly
confiscated the funds already secured, forbade all further collections,
and hastened to report his achievement to St. Petersburg.
To his astonishment, the overzealous Governor-General
received the chilling reply, that the Tzar found nothing criminal
in the desire of the Jews to send a deputation to him.
At the same time he was instructed to return the confiscated
money and not to interfere with the sending of the deputation
(September, 1798). Whether the deputation actually proceeded
to the capital, and what it achieved, is unknown. But
the occurrence in itself bears witness to the fact that even in
that unenlightened epoch and in the secluded Hasidic environment
of Volhynia and Podolia, the Jews were not altogether
insensible of the political and social upheavals which
were taking place in Russia.</p>

<p>The last to respond to the Governmental inquiry was the
nobility of Lithuania. The marshals of the nineteen Lithuanian
districts, who met in 1800, submitted their "opinion,"
which had been adopted with only three dissenting votes, to
Friesel, the Governor of Vilna. The three opposing marshals
suggested leaving the Jews in the condition which had prevailed
under the Polish <i>régime</i>. All the others drafted a plan
of Jewish "reform," which was even more radical than that
of the nobles of Minsk and Podolia. The Jews were to be
barred not only from distilling and keeping taverns of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
own, but also from the sale of spirits in the manorial public
houses. The Jewish rural population, which would thus be
deprived of all means of subsistence, was to be transferred
partly to the cities, partly "to be scattered over the crown
and manorial settlements, where they might be allowed to
grow corn and to mortgage and farm estates." The economic
reform was to be supplemented by one affecting the inner life
of the Jews. It was necessary "to abolish the Jewish costume
and introduce among the Jews the form of dress customary
among the other inhabitants." Altogether the separateness of
the Jews was to be broken down, for "they constitute a people
by themselves, and as such have their own administration ...
in the form of synagogues and Kahals, which not only arrogate
to themselves spiritual authority, but also meddle in all
civil affairs and in matters appertaining to the police." These
measures would bring about the amalgamation of the Jews
with the surrounding population.</p>

<p>The "reformatory" ardor of the Lithuanian nobles, who
thought it necessary to bracket the problem of Kahal autonomy
with the sale of alcohol, was the effect of outside interference.
Friesel, the Governor of Vilna, who was a cultivated
German, and as such was acquainted with the state of the
Jewish problem in Germany, found it necessary to address
himself to the Lithuanian marshals twice, their first statement
having been found "unsatisfactory." Only a second
revision of the views of the nobles, which included the plan of
inner reforms, satisfied Friesel. In April, 1800, Friesel forwarded
these recommendations to the Senate, accompanying
them by his own comprehensive memorandum, which to a large
extent was obviously based on Chatzki's and Butrymovich's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
projects submitted some ten years previously to the "Jewish
Commission" of the Quadrennial Diet.</p>

<p>Friesel urges the necessity of a "general reform," and
professes to take Western Europe as a model, but all he
adopted thence was the most objectionable tactics of "enlightened
absolutism." In his opinion "the education of
the Jewish people must begin with their religion." It is
necessary "to wipe out all Jewish sects with their superstitions
and to forbid strictly the introduction of any innovations
whereby impostors might seduce the masses and
plunge them into ever greater ignorance," a veiled allusion to
the Hasidim and in particular to their Tzaddiks, whose strife
with the anti-Hasidic rabbis was engaging the attention of the
Russian Government at the time. He further recommends
that the Jews be forced to send their children to the Government
schools, to conduct all their business in Polish, to wear
the customary non-Jewish form of dress, and not to marry
before the age of twenty. Finally the Jews are to be classified
in three categories, merchants, artisans, and tillers of the soil,
these three estates to form part of the general class stratification
of the Empire. In this way the fiscal services of the
Kahals could be dispensed with, and the Kahals themselves
would pass out of existence automatically.</p>

<p>The suggestions of the leaders of the nobility as well as the
proposals of the governors were turned over in the spring of
1800 to the Senate, whose function was to examine and utilize
them for a new legal enactment or "statute." Here they happened
to fall into the hands of one of the Senators, Gabriel
Dyerzhavin, the celebrated Russian poet, who by the whim of
fate was soon to blossom forth into a "specialist" <i>in rebus
Judaicis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">3. Dyerzhavin's "Opinion" on the Jewish Problem</span></p>

<p>Dyerzhavin was born in one of the remote eastern provinces
of Russia, and spent the greater part of his life in the Government
offices of St. Petersburg. He had never come in contact
with the Jewish population, until, in 1799, he was dispatched
to the little town of Shklov in White Russia, to
look into the case of the owner of the town, a retired general
by the name of Zorich. The latter had been one of the
favorites of Catherine, and lived the fast and extravagant
life of a Russian country squire in the town which was his
private property. His typically Russian devil-may-care conduct
was not calculated to spare the large Jewish population
of the town. Zorich evidently fancied that the Jews living
on his land were just as much his serfs as were the peasants,
and he handled them in the way serfs were dealt with in those
days. He expelled several of them from the town, and seized
their houses. Others he beat with his own hands, and still
others he forced to supply him with drink free of charge. The
Jews appealed to the Government against this attempt to turn
them into serfs, and it was in response to their appeal that
Emperor Paul dispatched Senator Dyerzhavin, with instructions
to curb the violence of the boisterous squire.
Dyerzhavin, who was imbued with the spirit of serfdom,
could not but take a mild view of the high-handed methods
of Zorich, and came to the conclusion that the Jews were
partly to blame for the disorders that had taken place. The
death of Zorich in 1800 put a stop to the case, but theoretically
the Senate decided that, according to Russian law, the Jews,
by virtue of their being members of the merchant and burgher
class, could not be regarded as serfs even in the towns and settlements
owned by squires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>A year later Dyerzhavin was again dispatched to White
Russia, this time invested with very large powers. The province
was in the throes of a terrible famine, brought about not
only by bad crops but also by the outrageous conduct of the
landed proprietors. These gentlemen, instead of supplying
their peasants with foodstuffs, preferred to send large quantities
of grain either abroad, for sale, or into their distilleries, for
the production of whiskey, which, instead of feeding the
peasants, poisoned them. In dispatching Dyerzhavin to White
Russia, Emperor Paul gave him full power to put a stop to
these abuses and to inflict severe penalties on the squires,
who, "moved by unexampled greed, leave their peasants
without assistance." They were to be dispossessed, and
their estates placed under state control (June 16, 1800). In
a supplementary instruction added by the Procurator-General
of the Senate, Obolanin, the following clause was added:
"And whereas, according to information received, the exhaustion
of the White Russian peasants is to a rather considerable
extent caused by the Zhyds, it is his Majesty's wish that your
Excellency may give particular attention to their part in it
and submit an opinion how to avert the general damage inflicted
by them." This unmistakably anti-Semitic postscript,
to which Dyerzhavin was in all likelihood a party, to which
at all events he gave his approval, was designed to mitigate the
blow aimed at the squires and turn it against the Jews. The
conspiracy of these two bureaucrats, who believed in serfdom
and sided with the squires, put an altogether different complexion
on Dyerzhavin's mission.</p>

<p>The pacification of White Russia was speedily accomplished.
Dyerzhavin placed the estate of one Polish magnate under state
control, and personally closed up a Jewish distillery in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
town of Lozno, the residence of the famous Hasidic Tzaddik,
Rabbi Zalman Shneorsohn. He proceeded with such energy that
one Jewish woman complained of having received blows at his
hands. After having "installed order," Dyerzhavin set out to
do what he considered to be his main task&mdash;prepare an
elaborate memorandum concerning the Jews, under the characteristic
title, "Opinion of Senator Dyerzhavin Concerning
the Averting of the Want of Foodstuffs in White Russia by
Curbing the Avaricious Pursuits of the Jews, also Concerning
Their Re-education, and Other Matters."</p>

<p>The very title betrays the underlying motive of the writer,
to make the Jews the scapegoat for the economic ruin of
the province, in which the squires had always been the masters
of the situation. But Dyerzhavin did not confine himself to
the evaluation of the economic activity of the Jews. He was
no less anxious to depict their inner life, their beliefs, their
training and education, their communal institutions, their
"moral situation." For all these purposes he drew upon a
multitude of sources. While writing his memorandum in
Vitebsk, in the fall of 1800, he gathered information about
the Jews from the local anti-Jewish merchants and burghers,
and from the "scientific" instructors at the Jesuit College in
the same city, in the court-houses, and&mdash;from "the very Cossacks
themselves."</p>

<p>It must be added that Dyerzhavin also had in his possession
two projects from the pen of "enlightened Jews." The
author of one of them, Nota Shklover by name, a wealthy merchant,
who had served as purveyor to Potemkin's army, and,
living at that time in St. Petersburg, knew the drift of
opinion in Government circles, proposed to attract the Jews
to manufacturing, which should be introduced, in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
with agriculture and cattle-breeding, into colonies set apart
for this purpose "in the neighborhood of the Black Sea ports."
The originator of the second project, a physician from Kreslavka,
in the Government of Vitebsk, by the name of Frank,&mdash;evidently
a German Jew of the Mendelssohnian type&mdash;suggested
that the Government through Dyerzhavin focus its attention
on the reform of the Jewish religion, which "in its original
purity rested on unadulterated Deism and the postulates of
pure morality," but in the course of time was distorted by "the
absurdities of the Talmud." Frank accordingly proposes to
follow the example set by Mendelssohn in Germany, to throw
open the Russian public schools to the Jews, and to teach their
children Russian, German, and Hebrew, implying of course
that the Jew thus educated will not fail to prove himself of
unquestionable benefit to the country.</p>

<p>Aside from these projects, Dyerzhavin had before him
specimens of several Prussian <i>Juden-Reglements</i>, as well as
the recommendations of the marshals and governors of Western
Russia referred to above, and similar documents.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> This
material sufficed for the Russian official, who had caught no
more than a fleeting glimpse of the Jews while passing through
White Russia, to elaborate a most comprehensive "Opinion"
demanding a complete transformation of Jewish life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>The somber picture which Dyerzhavin draws of the life of
the Jews suffices to show how superficial was his acquaintance
with the conditions he describes. The <i>naïveté</i> with which he
judges and completely distorts many aspects of Jewish life is
astounding. The economic pursuits of the Jews, such as trading,
leasing of land, innkeeping, brokerage, are nothing but
"subtle devices to squeeze out the wealth of their neighbors,
under the guise of offering them benefits and favors." The
Jewish school is "a hotbed of superstitions." Moral sentiments
are entirely absent among Jews: "they have no conception
of lovingkindness, disinterestedness, and other virtues."
All they do is "to collect riches in order to erect a
new temple of Solomon or [to satisfy] their fleshly desires."</p>

<p>This curious bit of characterization forms the preamble to
a vast scheme, consisting of no less than eighty-eight clauses,
looking to the "transformation of the Jews." The Jews are to
be placed under "Supreme [<i>i. e.</i> Imperial] protection and
tutelage" and to be supervised by a special Christian official,
a "Protector," who, with the assistance of committees to be
appointed by the gubernatorial administrations, shall carry
out this work of "transformation," shall take a census of
all the Jews, and provide them with family names. Thereupon
the Jews shall be divided into four categories: merchants,
urban burghers, rural burghers, and agricultural settlers,
and every Jew shall be forced to register in one of these
categories. All this mass of Jews is to be evenly distributed
over the various parts of White Russia, and the surplus transferred
to the other Governments.</p>

<p>This reform having been accomplished, the Kahals shall be
dispensed with. To provide for the management of the spiritual
affairs of the Jews, "synagogues," with rabbis and
"schoolmen," are to be organized in the various Governments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
A supreme ecclesiastic tribunal is to be established at St. Petersburg,
under the name "Sendarin,"<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> which shall be presided
over by a chief rabbi, or "patriarch," after the pattern of the
Mohammedan mufti of the Tatars.</p>

<p>Suggestions of various repressive and compulsory measures
supplement these positive proposals. The Jews are to be forbidden
to keep Christian domestics; they are to be deprived of
their right of participating in the city magistracies; they are
to be compelled to give up their distinct form of dress and to
execute all deeds and business documents in Russian, Polish,
or German. The children shall be allowed to go to the Jewish
religious schools only up to the age of twelve, and shall afterwards
be transferred to the secular schools of the state.
Finally the author proposes that the Government establish a
printing-office of its own, to publish Jewish religious books
"with philosophic annotations." In this way, Dyerzhavin
contends, will "the stubborn and cunning tribe of Hebrews
be properly set to rights," and Emperor Paul, by carrying out
this reform, will earn great fame for having fulfilled the commandment
of the Gospels, "Love your enemies, bless them
that curse you, do good to them that hate you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>Such is Dyerzhavin's project, a curious mixture of the
savage fancies of an old-fashioned Muscovite about an unfamiliar
historic culture on the one hand, and notions of
reform conceived in the contemporary Prussian barrack spirit
and various "philosophic" tendencies on the other hand, a
medley of hereditary Jew-hatred, vague appreciation of the
historic tragedy of Judaism, and the desire to "render the
Jews useful to the state."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> And over it all hovers the spirit
of official patronage and red-tape regulations, the curious
notion that a people with an ancient culture can, at the mere
bidding of an outside agency, change its position like figures
on a chess-board, that strange faith in the saving power of
<i>mechanical</i> reforms which prevailed, though in less naïve
manifestations, also in Western Europe.</p>

<p>Dyerzhavin's "Opinion" was laid before the Senate in
December, 1800, and together with the previously submitted
recommendations of the West-Russian marshals and governors
was to supply the material for an organic legal enactment concerning
the Jews.</p>

<p>But the execution of this plan was not destined to take place
during the reign of Paul. In March, 1801, the Tzar met his
tragic fate, and the cause of "Jewish reform" entered into
a new phase, a phase characterized by the struggle between the
liberal tendencies prevalent at the beginning of Alexander I.'s
reign and the retrograde views held by the champions of Old
Poland and Old Russia.<br /><br /></p>

well-known Prussian <i>Juden-Reglement für Süd- und-Neuostpreussen</i>
of 1797, which was at that time operative in the whole of
Prussian Poland. There are numerous points of contact between
Dyerzhavin's project and the Prussian enactment. The latter may

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
THE "ENLIGHTENED ABSOLUTISM" OF
ALEXANDER I.</h2>


<p>1. "<span class="smcap">The Committee for the Amelioration of the Jews</span>."</p>

<p>The liberal breeze which began to stir in the first years of
Alexander I.'s reign sent a refreshing current of air through
the stuffy atmosphere of the St. Petersburg chancelleries, in
which Russian bureaucrats, undisturbed by their utter ignorance
of Judaism, were devising ways and means of turning Jewish
life upside down. It took some time, however, before the
Jewish question was taken up again. In 1801 and 1802 the
Government was busy rearranging the whole machinery of
the administration. With the formation of the Ministries
and of the Council of State the Senate lost its former executive
power, and, as a result, the material relating to the Jewish
question which had been in its possession had to be transferred
to a new official agency.</p>

<p>Such an agency was called into being in November, 1802.
By order of the Tzar a special "Committee for the Amelioration
of the Jews" was organized, and the following were appointed
its members: Kochubay, Minister of the Interior,
Dyerzhavin, the "specialist" on Judaism, at that time
Minister of Justice, Count Zubov, and two high officials of
Polish birth, Adam Chartoriski, Assistant-Minister for
Foreign Affairs, an intimate friend of Alexander I., and
Severin Pototzki, a member of the Senate. The Committee
was charged with the investigation of all the problems touched
upon in Dyerzhavin's "Opinion," concerning the curbing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the avaricious pursuits of the Jews in White Russia, with a
view to "extending the amelioration of the Jews also to the
other Governments acquired from Poland."</p>

<p>Rumors to the effect that a special Committee on Jewish
affairs had been instituted at St. Petersburg, and that its work
was to follow the lines laid down in the project of Dyerzhavin,
caused considerable alarm among the Jews of the Northwest,
who knew but too well the anti-Semitic leanings of the former
Senator and inspector. The Kahal of Minsk held a special
meeting in December, 1802, which passed the following resolution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas disquieting rumors have reached us from the capital,
to the effect that matters involving the Jews as a whole have now
been intrusted to the hands of five dignitaries, with power to dispose
of them as they see fit, be it resolved that it is necessary to
proceed to St. Petersburg and petition our sovereign not to allow
them [the dignitaries] to introduce any innovations among us.</p></div>

<p>A public appeal was made for funds to provide the expenses
of the delegates. Moreover, a fast of three days was imposed
on all the members of the community, during which prayers
were to be offered up in the synagogues for averting the
calamity which the Government threatened to bring upon the
Jews.</p>

<p>When the Minister of the Interior, Kochubay, learned of the
excitement prevailing among the Jews, he sent, in January,
1803, a circular to the governors, instructing them to allay the
fears of the Jews. The Kahals were to be informed that "in
appointing the Committee for the investigation of Jewish
matters," there was "no intention whatsoever to impair their
status or to curtail any substantial advantage enjoyed by
them," but on the contrary it was proposed to "offer them
better conditions and greater security."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>This verbal assurance was not nearly so effective in quieting
the minds of the Jews as action taken by the Government
at the same time. In the beginning of 1803, the "Jewish
Committee" resolved to invite deputies from all the gubernatorial
Kahals to St. Petersburg for the purpose of ascertaining
their views as to the needs of the Jewish people,
which the Government had planned to "transform" without
its own knowledge. This was the first departure from the
red-tape routine of St. Petersburg. Towards the end of January,
1803, active preparations were set afoot by the Kahals
for sending such deputies. During the winter and spring the
Russian capital witnessed the arrival of Jewish deputies from
the Governments of Minsk, Podolia, Moghilev, and Kiev, no
information being available about the other Governments.
The deputies soon had occasion to rejoice in Dyerzhavin's
retirement from membership in the Jewish Committee, following
upon his resignation from the post of Minister of
Justice. Being a conservative of the "real Russian" type,
Dyerzhavin was out of place in a liberal Government such as
ruled the destinies of Russia in the early years of Alexander's
reign. With his retirement his "Opinion" ceased to serve as
an obligatory rule of conduct for the members of the Committee.</p>

<p>On arriving in St. Petersburg, the deputies from the provinces
found there a small group of Jews, mostly natives of
White Russia, who lived temporarily in the capital, in connection
with their business affairs. Though denied the right
of permanent domicile in the capital of the Empire, this handful
of barely tolerated Jews had managed to secure the right
of dying there and of burying their dead in their own cemetery.
The opening of the cemetery in 1802 marks symbolically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
the inception of the Jewish community in St. Petersburg. In
the same sign of death the provincial deputies met their metropolitan
brethren at a rather strange "celebration" in the summer
of 1803: at the suggestion of the deputies and in their
presence the remains of three Jews who had been buried in a
Christian cemetery were transferred to the newly-acquired
Jewish cemetery.</p>

<p>Among the Jews of St. Petersburg there were several men
at that time who, owing to their connections with high officials
and because of their familiarity with bureaucratic ways, were
able to be of substantial service to the deputies from the provinces.
One of these Jews, Nota Shklover, who about that time
received the family name Notkin, the same public-spirited
merchant who in 1800 had submitted his reform project to
Dyerzhavin,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> acted, it would seem, as the official adviser of the
deputies, having been invited some time previously to participate
in the labors of the Jewish Committee. While on the
Committee, he continually insisted on his scheme of promoting
agriculture and manufactures among the Jews, but he did
not live to see the triumph of his ideas. He died shortly before
the enactment of the law of 1804, in which his pet theory
found due recognition. Another St. Petersburg Jew, the
wealthy contractor and commercial councilor Abraham Peretz,
took no immediate part in Jewish affairs. Yet he too was of
some service to the deputies, owing to his business relations
with the official world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>In the meantime the Committee for the Amelioration of
the Jews, after scrutinizing the different projects submitted
to it, had worked out a general plan of reform, and
communicated it to the Jewish deputies. After "prolonged
indecision" the Jewish deputies announced that they were
not in a position to submit their conclusions, without previous
consultation with the Kahals by which they had been elected.
They accordingly asked for a half-year's respite "for the purpose
of consultation." The official Jewish Committee, on
the other hand, could not agree to so protracted a delay in
its labors, and resolved to submit, through the medium of the
Government, the principal clauses of the project to the Kahals,
with the understanding that the latter, "without making any
changes in the aforesaid clauses," should confine themselves
to suggestions as to the best ways and means of carrying the
proposed reforms into effect.</p>

<p>The epistolary inquiry failed to produce the "desired
effect." Restricted beforehand in their free expression of
opinion, and having no right to speak their mind as to the
substance of the project, the Kahals in replying limited themselves
to the request that the "correctional measures" be
postponed for twenty years, particularly as far as the proposed
prohibition of the sale of liquor and land-tenure was concerned,
which prohibition would undermine the whole economic
structure of Jewish life. The Committee paid no heed
to the plea of the Kahals, which was tantamount to a condemnation
of the basic principles of the project, and proceeded
to work in the direction originally decided upon.</p>

<p>Nor was there perfect unanimity within the Committee
itself. Two tendencies, it seems, were struggling for mastery:
utilitarianism, represented by the champions of "correctional
measures" and of a compulsory "transformation of Jewish
life," and humanitarianism, advocated by the spokesmen of
unconditional emancipation. To the latter class belonged
Speranski, the brilliant and enlightened statesman who might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
have succeeded in liberating the Empire of the Tzars a hundred
years ago, had he not fallen a victim to the fatal conditions
of Russian life. At the time we are speaking of he
served in the Ministry of the Interior under Kochubay, and
was engaged in elaborating plans of reform for the various
departments of the civil service.</p>

<p>Speranski took an active interest in the Committee for the
Amelioration of the Jews, and frequently acted as Kochubay's
substitute. There was a time when his influence in the
Committee was predominant. It was evidently under his influence
that the remarkable sentences embodied in the minutes of
the Committee meeting of September 20, 1803, were penned:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Reforms brought about by the power of the state are, as a rule,
unstable, and are particularly untenable in those cases in which
that power has to grapple with the habits of centuries. Hence it
seems both better and safer to guide the Jews to perfection by
throwing open to them the avenues leading to their own happiness,
by observing their movements from a distance, and by removing
everything that might turn them away from this path, without
using any manner of force, without establishing special agencies
for them, without endeavoring to act in their stead, but by merely
opening the way for their own activities. As few restrictions as
possible, as many liberties as possible&mdash;these are the simple elements
of every social order.</p></div>

<p>Since the Government had begun to dabble in the Jewish
question, this was the first rational utterance coming from the
ranks of the Russian bureaucracy. It implied an emphatic condemnation
of the system of state patronage and "correctional
measures" by means of which Russian officialdom then
and thereafter sought to "transform" a whole nation. Here
for the first time was voiced the lofty precept of humanitarianism:
grant the Jews untrammeled possibilities of development,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
give full scope to their energies, and the Jews themselves will
in the end choose the way which leads to "perfection" and
progress.... But even the liberalizing statesmen of that
period could not maintain themselves on that high eminence
of political thought. Speranski's conception was too tender
a blossom for the rough climate of Russia, even in its springtide.
The blossom was bound to wither. As far as the Committee for
the Amelioration of the Jews was concerned, the hackneyed
political wisdom of the age, the system of patronage and compulsory
reforms, came to the fore again. The report submitted
by the Jewish Committee to Alexander I. in October, 1804,
reveals no trace of that radical liberalism which a year before
had come to light in the minutes of the Committee.</p>

<p>The report begins by determining the approximate size of
the Jewish population, computing the number of registered,
taxable males at 174,385&mdash;"a figure which represents less
than a fifth of the whole Jewish population." In other words,
the total number of Jews, in the estimate of the Committee,
approached one million. The report proceeds to point out that
this entire mass is huddled together in the annexed Polish and
Lithuanian provinces and in Little Russia and Courland,
and is barred from the Governments of the interior&mdash;a statement
followed by an historical excursus tending to show that
"the Jews have never been allowed to settle in Russia." The
Tzar is further informed that the Jews are obliged to pay
double taxes, that, notwithstanding the fact that they are
liable to the general courts and municipalities, and that their
Kahals are subordinate to the gubernatorial police, the Jews
still keep aloof from the institutions of the land and manage
their affairs through the Kahals. Finally it is pointed out that
the sale of liquor, the most widespread occupation among Jews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
is a source of abuses, calling forth complaints from the surrounding
population. Basing its deductions on these premises,
the Committee drafted a law which in its principal
features was embodied in the "Statute Concerning the Organization
of the Jews," issued, with the sanction of the Tzar,
soon afterwards, on December 9, 1804.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The "Jewish Constitution" of 1804</span></p>

<p>The new charter, a mixture of liberties and disabilities, was
prompted, as is stated in the preamble, "by solicitude for the
true welfare of the Jews," as well as for "the advantage of
the native population of those Governments in which these
people are allowed to live." The concluding part of the sentence
anticipates the way in which the question of the Jewish
area of settlement is solved. It remained limited as theretofore
to thirteen Governments: two in Lithuania, two in
White Russia, two in Little Russia, those of Minsk, Volhynia,
Kiev, and Podolia, and finally three in New Russia. A slightly
larger area is conceded by the new statute to the <i>future</i> class of
Jewish agriculturists projected in the same statute. They are
permitted to settle in addition in two interior Governments,
those of Astrakhan and Caucasia.</p>

<p>Economically the new statute establishes two opposite poles:
a negative pole as far as the rural occupations of innkeeping
and land-tenure are concerned, which are to be exterminated
ruthlessly, and a positive pole, as far as agriculture is involved,
which on the contrary is to be stimulated and promoted
among Jews in every possible manner. Clause 34, the severest
provision of the whole act, is directed not only against innkeeping
but against rural occupations in general. It reads as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beginning with January 1, 1807, in the Governments of Astrakhan
and Caucasia, also in those of Little Russia and New
Russia, and, beginning with January 1, 1808, in the other Governments,
<i>no one among the Jews in any village or hamlet shall be
permitted to hold any leases on land, to keep taverns, saloons, or
inns</i>, whether under his own name or under a strange name, or to
sell wine in them, or <i>even to live in them</i> under any pretext whatever,
except when passing through.</p></div>

<p>With one stroke this clause eliminated from the economic
life of the Jews an occupation which, though far from being
distinguished, had yet afforded a livelihood to almost one-half
of the whole Jewish population of Russia. Moreover, the
none too extensive territory of the Jewish Pale of Settlement
was still more limited by excluding from it the enormous area
of villages and hamlets.</p>

<p>The economic and legal blow aimed at the Jews in the
Statute of 1804 was to be made good by the privileges held
forth to those willing to engage in agriculture. Such Jews
were accorded the right of buying unoccupied lands in all
the western and in two of the eastern Governments, or of
establishing themselves on crown lands. In the latter case
the settlers were to be assigned definite parcels of land and,
for the first few years, be exempt from state taxes. However,
it soon became evident that the proposed remedy was out of
proportion to the seriousness of the wound that had been
inflicted. While hundreds of thousands of Jews were driven
from the rural occupations with which their economic life
had been bound up for centuries, the new branch of labor
opened to the Jews, the pursuit of agriculture, could, for
some time to come, attract at the utmost only a few insignificant
groups of the Jewish population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the favored occupations, ranging in importance
beneath agriculture, the new law includes industry and handicrafts.
Manufacturers and artisans are declared exempt from
the double tax imposed on Jews,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and the founders of "the most
needed factories" are promised, in addition, a Government
loan. The Jewish merchants and burghers are placed in the
last rank, being merely "tolerated." Manufacturers, artisans,
and merchants are given permission to sojourn temporarily for
business purposes in "the interior Governments, not excluding
the capitals, but not otherwise than with gubernatorial passports,"
such as are given for going abroad.</p>

<p>In the chapter entitled "On the Civil Organization of the
Jews," the new charter establishes, on the one hand, the liability
of the Jews to the authority of the municipalities, the
common police, and the common law courts, and grants the
Jews, on the other hand, the right of electing rabbis and
"Kahalmen," who shall be replaced every three years, and shall
be ratified by the gubernatorial administration. Special clauses
provide that the rabbis are obliged "to look after all the
ceremonies of the Jewish faith and decide all disputes bearing
on religion," but they are strictly forbidden to resort to
"anathemas" and excommunications (the so-called herem).
The Kahals in turn are held responsible for the regular payment
of the state taxes. The communal autonomy of the Jews
was thus calculated to serve two masters, religion and the
exchequer, God and mammon, and was expected to adjust
its manifold problems to both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>The "Jewish Constitution" of 1804 is provided as it were
with a European label. Its first chapter bears the heading
"On Enlightenment." Jewish children are granted free access
to all public schools, gymnasiums, and universities in the Russian
Empire. The Jews are also granted the right of opening
their own schools for secular culture, one of three languages,
Russian, Polish, or German, to be obligatory. One
of these languages is also, within a period of two to six years
from the promulgation of the law, to become obligatory for all
public documents, promissory notes, commercial ledgers, etc.
The Jews elected members of municipalities or chosen as
rabbis and Kahal members are obliged, within a definite term
(1808-1812), to know one of these three languages to the extent
of being able to write and speak it. Moreover, the Jewish members
of the municipalities are expected to wear clothes of the
Polish, Russian, or German pattern.</p>

<p>This "enlightened" program represents the tribute which
the Russian Government felt obliged to render to the spirit
of the age, the spirit of enlightened Prussian absolutism rather
than that of French emancipation. It was the typical sample
of a Prusso-Austrian <i>Reglement</i>, embodying the very system
of "reforms brought about by the power of the state"
against which Speranski had vainly cautioned. In concrete
reality this system resulted in nothing else than the violent
break-up of a structure built by centuries, relentless coercion
on the one hand and suffering of the patronized masses on the
other.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">3. The Projected Expulsion from the Villages</span></p>

<p>The legal enactment of 1804 was appraised by the Russian
Jews at its true value: problematic benefits in the future and
undeniable hardships for the present. The prospect of future
benefits, the attainment of which was conditioned by the
weakening of the time-honored foundations of a stalwart Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
cultural life, expressing itself in language, school, and communal
self-government, had no fascination for Russian Jews,
who had not yet been touched by the influences of Western
Europe. But what the Russian Jews did feel, and feel with
sickening pain, was the imminence of a terrible economic catastrophe,
the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Jews from
the villages. It soon became evident that the expulsion would
affect 60,000 Jewish families, or about half a million Jews.
Needless to say, within the two or three years of respite which
remained before the catastrophe, this huge mass could not possibly
gain access to new fields of labor and establish itself in
new domiciles, and it was therefore in danger of being starved
to death. In consequence, St. Petersburg was flooded with
petitions imploring the authorities to postpone the expulsion
for a time. These petitions came not only from the Kahals but
also from country squires, for whom the removal of the Jewish
tenants and innkepeers from their estates entailed considerable
financial losses. With the approach of the year 1808, the time
limit set for the expulsion, the shouts of despair from the
provinces became louder and louder. It is difficult to say
whether the Russian Government would have responded to the
terrible outcry, had it not been for an event which set all the
political circles of St. Petersburg agog.</p>

<p>It was in the autumn of 1806. The "Jewish Parliament"
in Paris, which had been assembled by Napoleon, was concluding
its sessions, and was sending out appeals to all the
countries of Europe announcing the impending convocation
of the "Great Synhedrion." This new fad of Napoleon disturbed
all the European Governments which were on terms of
enmity with the French Emperor, and had reason to fear
the discontent of their Jewish subjects. The Austrian Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
went so far as to forbid the Jews to enter into any relations
with "dangerous" Paris. St. Petersburg too became
alarmed. Napoleon, who had just shattered Prussia, and had
already entered her Polish provinces, was gradually approaching
the borders of hostile Russia. The awe inspired by the
statesmanlike genius of the French Emperor made the Russian
Government suspect that the convocation of a universal Jewish
Synhedrion in Paris was merely a Napoleonic device to
dispose the Jewish masses of Prussia, Austria, and Russia in
his favor. In these circumstances it seemed likely that the
resentment aroused in the Russian Jews by their imminent
expulsion from the villages would provide a favorable soil for
the wily agitation of Napoleon, and would create a hotbed
of anti-Russian sentiment in the very regions soon to become
the theater of war. To avoid such risks it seemed imperative
to extinguish the flame of discontent and stop the expulsion.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that in the beginning of February,
1807, at the very moment when the sessions of the Synhedrion
were opened in Paris, the Minister of the Interior, Kochubay,
submitted a report to Alexander I., in which he pointed out the
necessity "of postponing the transplantation of the Jews from
the villages into the towns and townlets, so as to guard this
nation in general against the intentions of the French Government."
The Tzar concurred in this opinion, with the result
that a special committee was immediately formed to consider
the practical application of the Statute of 1804. Apart from
Kochubay and other high officials, the committee included the
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Budberg, diplomatic considerations
being involved in the question. On February 15, Senator
Alexeyev was directed to inspect the western provinces and
find out to what extent "the military circumstances and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
present condition of the border provinces as well as the
economic ruin of the Jews, which is inevitable if their expulsion
be enforced," render this expulsion difficult or even impossible
of execution.</p>

<p>At the same time the Minister of the Interior instructed the
administrators of the western Governments to prevent the
slightest contact between the Jews of Russia and the Synhedrion
in Paris, which the French Government was using as
a tool to curry political favor with the Jews. The same circular
letter to the Governors recommends another rather curious
device. It suggests that the Jews be impressed with the idea
that the Synhedrion in Paris was endeavoring to modify the
Jewish religion, and for this reason did not deserve the
sympathy of the Russian Jews.</p>

<p>At the same time the Holy Synod was sending out circulars
instructing the Greek Orthodox clergy to inform the
Russian people that Napoleon was an enemy of the Church
and a friend of the Jews.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That he might the more effectively put the Church of Christ to
shame&mdash;so the Holy Synod proclaimed&mdash;Napoleon assembled the
Judean Synagogues in France ... and established the Great
Synhedrion of the Jews, that same ungodly assembly which had
once dared pass the sentence of crucifixion upon our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ, and he now planneth to unite the Jews, whom
the wrath of the Almighty hath scattered over the face of the whole
earth, so as to incite them to overthrow the Christian Church and
proclaim the pseudo-Messiah in the person of Napoleon.</p></div>

<p>By these devices the Government, finding itself at its wits'
end in the face of a great war, shrewdly attempted to frighten at
once the Jewish people by the specter of an anti-Jewish Napoleon
and the Orthodox Russians by Napoleon's leaning
towards Judaism. The former were made to believe that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Synhedrion was directed against the Jewish religion, and the
latter were told that it was established by the Jewish "pseudo-Messiah"
for the overthrow of Christianity.</p>

<p>In this precarious situation the Government once more
decided to ascertain, by means of a circular inquiry, the views
of the representatives of the Jewish communities on the best
ways of carrying the "reform" into effect. The ukase of
February 19, issued by the Tzar on this occasion, is couched in
surprisingly mild terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Prompted by the desire to give our subjects of the Jewish
nationality another proof of our solicitude about their welfare, we
have deemed it right to allow all the Jewish communes in the
Governments ... of Vilna, Grodno, Kiev, Minsk, Podolia, Volhynia,
Vitebsk, and Moghilev, to elect deputies and to suggest, through
them, to the gubernatorial administrators the means which they
themselves consider best fitted for the most successful execution
of the measures laid down in the Statute of 1804.</p></div>

<p>The deputies were summoned this time, not to St. Petersburg,
but to the provincial capitals in order to present their
opinions to the governors.</p>

<p>The expression of opinion on the part of the Jewish deputies,
or, as they were officially styled, "the attorneys of the
Jewish communes," did not limit itself to the fatal thirty-fourth
clause, which all the deputies wished to see repealed
or at least postponed for an indefinite period. Serious objections
were raised also to the other provisions of the "Jewish
Constitution." The deputies advocated the abolition of double
taxation for all classes of the Jewish population; they asked
for a larger range of authority for the rabbinical tribunals and
for a mitigation of the provisions forbidding the use of Hebrew
in legal documents, promissory notes, and commercial ledgers.
Some of them pleaded for a postponement of the law concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Hebrew as being inconvenient to business, while others
suggested permitting the use of Hebrew for promissory notes
up to the sum of one hundred rubels.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>The deputies also called attention to the difficulty, on the
part of the rabbis and Jewish members of the magistracies, of
acquiring the Russian language within so short a period. They
were ready to assent to the change of dress for the magistrates
and those living temporarily outside the Pale. But they
pointed out at the same time that the prescribed German
dress was not becoming to Jews, who on account of religious
scruples refused to shave their beards, and that in the case
of magistrates and visitors to the Russian interior they would
prefer to adopt the Russian form of dress. As for the laws
relating to education, the deputies observed that it would be
useless for Jewish children to go to the common Russian
schools as long as they did not understand the Russian language,
and that it would for this reason seem more practicable
first to have them acquire the Russian language in the
Jewish schools, where they are taught the Hebrew language
and the "dogmas of the faith."</p>

<p>By the time the opinions of the deputies were conveyed
by the governors to St. Petersburg, the political sentiment
there had undergone a change. In July, 1807, the Peace
of Tilsit had been concluded. An <i>entente cordiale</i> had been
established between Napoleon and Alexander I., and Russia
no more stood in awe of Bonaparte's "intrigues." There
was no more reason to fear a secret understanding between
the Russian Jews and the Parisian Synhedrion, which had
shortly before been prorogued, and the bureaucratic compassion
for the unfortunate Jews vanished into air. The last
term set for the expulsion from the villages, January 1, 1808,
was drawing near, and two months before this date, on
October 19, 1807, the Tzar addressed an ukase, marked by
extraordinary severity, to the Governor-General of the Western
region:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>The circumstances connected with the war&mdash;the ukase states in
part&mdash;were of a nature to complicate and suspend the transplantation
of the Jews.... These complications can now, after the
cessation of the war, be averted in the future by means of a gradual
and most convenient arrangement of the work of transplantation....
For these reasons we deem it right to lay down an arrangement
by means of which the transplantation of the Jews, beginning
with the date referred to above, may be carried into effect,
without the slightest delay and mitigation.</p></div>

<p>The "arrangement" alluded to consisted in spreading the
expulsion from the villages over three years: one-third of
the Jews were to be expelled in 1808, another third in 1809,
and the last third in 1810. Committees were appointed to
assist the governors in carrying out the expulsion decree.
These committees were instructed to make it incumbent upon
the Kahals to render financial assistance to the expelled, to
those who were being pitilessly ruined by the Government.</p>

<p>The horrors of the expulsion began.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Those who did not go willingly were made to leave by force.
Many were ejected ruthlessly, under the escort of peasants and
soldiers. They were driven like cattle into the townlets and
cities, and left there on the public squares in the open air. The
way in which the expulsion from the villages was carried out in the
Government of Vitebsk was particularly ferocious.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>Scores of exiled Jews petitioned the authorities to have them
transferred to New Russia, to the agricultural colonies, in
which several hundred Jewish families had found some kind
of shelter. But the supply of arable land and the funds set
aside for the transfer were found to be exhausted; the appeals
therefore remained unheeded. The distress of the Jewish
masses reached such colossal proportions that the governors
themselves, in their reports to the central Government, declared
that it was impossible to carry out the expulsion decree
without subjecting the Jews to complete ruin. Accordingly
a new ukase was issued in the last days of December, 1808,
to the effect that the Jews be left in their former domiciles,
pending special Imperial orders.</p>

<p>In the beginning of January, 1809, a new Committee
(chronologically the third) was appointed in St. Petersburg
for the purpose of examining all the phases of the problem of
diverting the Jews from the rural liquor traffic to other
branches of labor. This time the committee consisted of
Senator Alexeyev,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> who had made a tour of inspection through
the western provinces, Privy-Councilor Popov, Assistant Minister
of the Interior Kozodavlev, and others. In his instructions
to Popov, who was chairman of the Committee, the
Tzar admits that the impossibility of removing the Jews from
the villages results from the fact that "the Jews themselves,
on account of their destitute condition, have no means which
would enable them, after leaving their present abodes, to
settle and found a home in their new surroundings, while the
Government is equally unable to undertake to place them
all in new domiciles." It has therefore been found necessary
"to seek ways and means whereby the Jews, having been
removed from their exclusive pursuit of selling wine in the
villages, hamlets, inns, and public houses, may be enabled to
earn a livelihood by labor." At the same time the Committee
was directed to take into consideration the "opinions" submitted
previously by the Jewish deputies. After indulging in
cruel vivisectionist experiments on human beings, the Government
finally realized that mere paper orders were powerless to
remodel an economic order, which centuries of development
had created, and that violent expulsions and restrictions might
result in ruining people, but not in effecting their "amelioration."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>The Committee was at work for three years. The results of
its labors were embodied in a remarkable report submitted in
March, 1812, to Alexander I. Since Speranski's declaration
of 1803, reproduced above,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> this official document was the first
to utter a word of truth on the Jewish problem.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is proposed&mdash;the report declares&mdash;to remove the Jews from
the rural liquor traffic, because the latter is considered harmful
to the population. But it is obvious that the root of the drinking
evil is not to be found with the saloon-keepers, but in the right of
distilling, or "propination," which constitutes the prerogative of
the squires and their main source of income. Let us suppose the
sixty thousand Jewish saloon-keepers to be turned out from the
villages. The result will be that sixty thousand Russian peasants
will take their place, tens of thousands of efficient farm-hands will
be lost to the soil, while the Jews cannot be expected to be transformed
into capable agriculturists at a moment's notice, the less so
as the Government has no resources to effect this sudden transformation
of saloon-keepers into corn-growers. It is not true that the
village Jew enriches himself at the expense of the peasant. On
the contrary, he is generally poor, and ekes out a scanty existence
from the sale of liquor and by supplying the peasants with the
goods they need. Moreover, by buying the corn on the spot, the
Jew saves the peasant from wasting his time in traveling to the
city. Altogether in rural economic life the Jew plays the rôle of
a go-between, who can be spared neither by the squire nor by the
peasant. To transfer all village Jews to the cities and convert
them into manufacturers, merchants, and artisans, is a matter of
impossibility, for even the Jewish population already settled in the
cities is scarcely able to make a living, and to create factories and
mills artificially would be throwing money into the water,
especially as the exchequer has no free millions at its disposal to
enable it to grant subsidies to manufacturers. The recent experiments
of the Government have had no effect. On the contrary, the
Jewish people "has not only remained in the same state of
poverty, but has even been reduced to greater destitution, as a
result of having been forced out of a pursuit which had provided
it with a livelihood for several centuries." Hence, "the Committee,
realizing this situation of a whole people, and being afraid
that the continuation of compulsory measures, <i>in the present
political circumstances</i>, may only exasperate this people, already
restricted to the utmost, deems it necessary ... to put a resolute
stop to the now prevailing methods of interference by allowing
the Jews to remain in their former abodes and by setting free the
pursuits suspended by Clause 34."</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>The Government submitted. In yielding it was moved
not so much by the clear and incontrovertible arguments
of the Committee, which amounted to a deadly criticism of
the current system of state patronage, as by the "political
circumstances" alluded to in the concluding sentences of the
report. Napoleon's army was marching towards the Russian
frontier. The war which was to embroil the whole of Russia
and subsequently the whole of Europe had broken out. At
such a moment, when the French army was flooding the whole
of Western Russia, it seemed far more dangerous to create
groups of persecuted and embittered outcasts than it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
in 1807, when the French invasion was merely a matter of
apprehension. In these circumstances the question whether
the Jews should be left in the villages and hamlets found a
favorable solution of itself, without any special ukase. Stirred
to the core, Russia, in the moment of national danger, had to
rely for her salvation upon the strenuous exertions of all her
inhabitants, Jews included.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">4. The Patriotic Attitude of Russian Jewry during
the War of 1812</span></p>

<p>The part played by the Jews in the War of 1812 was not
so insignificant as historians are generally disposed to assume,
being misled by the fact that the Jews of Russia were not
yet drafted into the army. It must be borne in mind that
the great war was enacted in western Russia, more particularly
in northwestern Russia, on territory inhabited
by a compact Jewish population scattered all over the cities,
townlets, and villages. The sympathy of this population
with one or the other of the belligerents frequently decided
the success or failure of the detachment situated in that
locality. It is a well-known fact that the Poles of the
western region were mostly on the side of Napoleon, from
whom they expected the restoration of the Polish kingdom.</p>

<p>As for the Russian Jews, their attitude towards the belligerent
parties was of a more complicated character. The
recent persecutions of the rural Jews were apt, on the one
hand, to set their hearts against the Russian Government,
and, had these persecutions continued, the French would have
been hailed by the oppressed Jews as their saviors. But the expulsions
from the villages had been stopped three years before
the war, and the Jews anticipated the complete repeal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
the cruel law, which had been so severely condemned in the
official report of the Committee laid before the Tzar in the
beginning of 1812. Moreover, the deputies of the Kahals,
who had been summoned twice to share in the work of the
Government (in 1803 and 1807), had an opportunity to convince
themselves that Alexander I.'s Government was on the
whole favorably disposed towards the Jews, and its mistakes
were merely the outcome of the wrong system of state patronage,
of the desire of the Government to make the Jews happy,
according to its own lights, by employing compulsory and "correctional"
measures.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Napoleon's halo had been considerably
dimmed even in the eyes of the Jews of Western Europe, now
that the results of his "Jewish Parliaments" had come to
light. The Jews of Russia, who were all Orthodox, regarded
Napoleon's reform schemes as fraught with danger, and looked
upon the substitution of Kahal autonomy by a consistorial
organization as subversive of Judaism. The Hasidic party,
again, which was the most conservative, felt indebted to Alexander
I., who, in a clause of the Statute of 1804, bearing on
Jewish sects, had bestowed upon the Hasidim the right of
segregating themselves in separate synagogues within the communities.
The leader of the White Russian Hasidim, Rabbi
Shneor Zalman, who at first had suffered from the suspiciousness
of the Russian Government, but was afterwards declared
to be politically "dependable," voiced the sentiments of the influential
Jewish circles towards the two belligerent sovereigns
in the following prediction:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Should Bonaparte win, the wealth of the Jews will be increased,
and their [civic] position will be raised. At the same time their
hearts will be estranged from our Heavenly Father. Should however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>our Tzar Alexander win, the Jewish hearts will draw nearer
to our Heavenly Father, though the poverty of Israel may become
greater and his position lower.</p></div>

<p>This was tantamount to saying that civic rightlessness was
preferable to civic equality, inasmuch as the former bade fair to
guarantee the inviolability of the religious life, while the latter
threatened to bring about its disintegration.</p>

<p>All these circumstances, coupled with the unconscious resentment
of the masses against the invading enemy, brought
about the result that the Jews of the Northwest everywhere
gave tokens of their devotion to the interests of Russia, and
frequently rendered substantial services to the Russian army
in its commissary and reconnoitring branches. The well-known
Russian partisan<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Davidov relates that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>the frame of mind of the Polish inhabitants of Grodno was
very unfavorable to us. The Jews living in Poland were, on the
other hand, all so devoted to us that they refused to serve the
enemy as scouts, and often gave us most valuable information
concerning him.</p></div>

<p>As Polish officials could not be relied upon, it became
necessary to intrust the whole police department of Grodno to
the Jewish Kahal. The Governor of Vilna testified that "the
Jewish people had shown particular devotion to the Russian
Government during the presence of the enemy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>The Poles were irritated by this pro-Russian attitude of the
Jews. There were rumors afloat that the Poles had made
ready to massacre all Jews and Russians in the Governments
of Vilna and Minsk and in the province of Bialystok. There
were numerous instances of self-sacrifice. It happened more
than once that Jews who had sheltered Russian couriers with
dispatches in their houses, or had escorted them to the Russian
headquarters, or who had furnished information to the Russian
commanders as to the position of the enemy's army, were
caught by the French, and shot or hanged. Alexander I. was
aware of these deeds. While on a visit to Kalish, he granted
an audience to the members of the Kahal, and engaged in a
lengthy conversation with them. Among the Jews of the district
appeals written in the Jewish vernacular were circulated,
in which the Jews were called upon to offer up prayers for the
success of Alexander I., who would release the Jewish people
from bondage. Altogether the wave of patriotism which swept
over Russia engulfed the Jewish masses to a considerable
extent.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the Russian army, which was now
marching towards the West, harbored, during the years 1812-1813,
two Jewish deputies, Sundel Sonnenberg of Grodno and
Leyser (Eliezer) Dillon of Neswizh. On the one hand they
maintained connections with the leading Government officials,
and conveyed to them the wishes of the Jewish communities.
On the other hand they kept up relations with the Kahals,
which they informed regularly of the intentions of the Government.
Presumably these two public-spirited men played a
twofold rôle at headquarters: that of large purveyors, who
received orders directly from the Russian commissariat, and
forwarded them to their local agents, and that of representatives
of the Kahals, whose needs they communicated to the
Tzar and the highest dignitaries of the crown. In those uneasy
times the Government found it to its advantage to keep at its
headquarters representatives of the Jewish population, who
might sway the minds of their coreligionists, in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
with the character of the political instructions issued by it.
In June, 1814, during his stay abroad in Bruchsal (Germany),
Alexander requested these deputies to assure "the Jewish
Kahals of his most gracious favor," and promised to issue
shortly "an ordinance concerning their wishes and requests for
the immediate amelioration of their present condition." It
seems that Alexander I., who was still under the spell of the accounts
of Jewish patriotism, was inclined at that moment to
improve their lot. But the general reaction which, after the
Vienna Congress of 1815, fell like a blight upon Europe and
Russia proved fatal also to the Russian Jews.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">5. Economic and Agricultural Experiments</span></p>

<p>The political upheavals of the transition period (1789-1815)
were bound to react violently on the economic status
of Russo-Polish Jewry. The vast Jewish population of Western
Russia was at that time divided into two parts: the
larger part resided in the towns and townlets, the smaller
lived in the villages. The efforts made by the Russian Government
during that period, to squeeze the whole Jewish population
into the urban estates and to single out from its midst
a new class of agriculturists, failed to produce the desired
effect. Instead it succeeded in disturbing the former equilibrium
between the urban and the rural occupations of the Jews.</p>

<p>The urban Jew was either a business man or an artisan or a
saloon-keeper. In many cities the Jewish mercantile element
was numerically superior to the Christian. The increased
Jewish activity in the export trade is particularly noticeable.
Jewish merchants traveled annually in large numbers to the
fairs abroad, particularly to that of Leipsic, to buy merchandise,
principally dry goods, at the same time exporting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
products of Poland and Russia, such as furs, skins, etc. The
gradual absorption of Polish territory by Russia opened up
a new, immense market, that of the central Russian provinces,
for the goods imported from abroad. It was natural that the
Jews began to flock to those provinces. But their way was at
once blocked by the local Russian merchants, who began to
clamor against Jewish competition, and forced the Government
to recognize the monopoly of native "interests," to the detriment
of the consumer.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>True, the monopolists did not succeed altogether in shutting
the Russian interior to foreign cheap goods and finery, which the
Jewish merchants still continued to import, under the clause
in the Statute of 1804 which granted Jews the right of visiting
the interior Governments on special gubernatorial passports.
Yet an untrammeled development of Jewish commerce was rendered
impossible by this artificial barrier between Western
and Eastern Russia.</p>

<p>The second urban profession, handicrafts, was considered
of lower rank than commerce. It was pursued by the poorest
class of the population. Artisan labor commanded very low
prices. Purely Jewish trade-unions were rare, and when a
Jewish artisan summoned enough courage to leave his native
townlet and seek employment in a large city, he was sure to
encounter the animosity of the organized Christian guilds.
We have seen that before the second partition of Poland such
an "encounter" assumed the shape of a pogrom in the
Polish capital.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>By the side of the store and the workshop stood the public
house or saloon, which was generally connected with an inn
or a hostelry. The sale of liquor in the cities depended
primarily on the peasants arriving from the villages on festival
and market days. On the whole the liquor traffic occupied
a subordinate place in the cities. Its mainstay was in the
villages.</p>

<p>All serious observers of the economic status of the Jews
at that time bear witness to the fact that in the majority
of cities Jewish labor formed the corner-stone of a civilized
economic life, that without the Jew it was impossible to
buy, or to sell, or to have any kind of article made. The
Jew, who was satisfied with small wages and profits, was
thereby able to lower both the cost of production and the price
of merchandise. He was content with a pittance, his physical
needs being extraordinarily limited. Thanks to the mediation
of the ubiquitous Jewish business man, the peasant was able to
dispose of his products on the spot, even those which because
of their small value would not be worth carrying to the city.
In spite of all his indefatigable, feverish labors, the Jew was on
the average as poor as the peasant, except that he was free from
the vice of drunkenness, one of the sources of the peasant's
economic misery. The poverty of the Jew was the artificial
result of the fact that the cities and townlets were overcrowded
with petty tradesmen and artisans, and this congestion was
further aggravated by the systematic removal of the Jews
from their age-long rural occupations and the consequent
influx of village Jews into the towns.</p>

<p>It is necessary to point out that when the official records
harp on the "liquor traffic" in the villages as the sole occupation
of Jews, they fail to appreciate the many-sidedness of the
rural pursuits of the Jews, which were connected with the
liquor traffic, to be sure, but were by no means identical with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
While leasing from the squire or the crown the right of distilling,
the Jew farmed at the same time other items of rural
economy, such as the dairies, the mills, and the fishing ponds.
He was furthermore engaged in buying grain from the peasants
and selling them at the same time such indispensable
articles as salt, utensils, agricultural tools, etc., imported by him
from the town. He often combined in his person the occupations
of liquor-dealer, shopkeeper, and produce merchant. The
road leading from the village to the city was dotted with
Jewish inns or public houses, which, before the age of railroads,
served as halting-places for travelers. This whole
economic structure, which had been built up gradually in the
course of centuries, the Russian Government made its business
to demolish. As early as the reign of Catherine II. the governors
frequently drove the Jewish villagers into the cities,
acting under the "organic law" which makes it incumbent
upon Jews to "register among the merchants or burghers."
The ambiguous ukase of 1795, to the effect, that "endeavors
be made to transplant the Jews into the District towns, so that
these people may not wander about to the detriment of
society," gave the zealous bureaucrats a free hand. When the
Law of 1804 ordered the expulsion of all Jews from the villages
at the end of three years, many squires, without waiting for
the time limit to expire, refused their Jewish tenants the right
of residence and trade in their villages. The Jews began to
rush into the cities, where even the long-settled residents
could not manage to make a living.</p>

<p>True, the Government was luring the persecuted Jews into
two new vocations, the establishment of factories and of agricultural
colonies. But the impecunious village Jew had neither
the capital nor the capacity for opening factories. Moreover, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
was of no conceivable use to call industries artificially into
being, without having first secured a market for the manufactured
products. Several woolen mills had been founded by
Jews in Lithuania and Volhynia, but all they could do was to
provide work for a few thousand people. It was thus natural
that all eyes turned towards agricultural colonization.</p>

<p>The Statute of 1804 promised to provide impecunious Jews
desirous of engaging in agriculture with free land in several
Governments, to grant them loans for their equipment, and
exempt them from taxation for a number of years. The
exiled village Jews clutched at this promise as an anchor of
salvation. In 1806 several Jewish groups in the Government
of Moghilev appealed to the governor to transfer them to New
Russia, there to engage in corn-growing. The delegate of
one of these groups, Nahum Finkelstein, even traveled to
St. Petersburg to lay the matter before Minister Kochubay,
and was dispatched by the latter to the Government of
Kherson for the purpose of inspecting and selecting the land.
The Minister, acting in agreement with the Governor of Kherson,
Duke Richelieu, decided to set aside separate parcels of
land in the steppes of that region and to settle Jews on
them under the auspices of the New Russian "Immigration
Bureau." Scarcely had the two Moghilev groups completed
the arrangements for their emigration, when scores of similar
applications began to come in from Jewish groups in other
Governments of the Pale. By the end of 1806 the number of
applicants mounted up to fifteen hundred families, numbering
some seven thousand souls. The Russian authorities found
themselves in an awkward position. They were caught unprepared
for the transfer of so many persons at the expense of the
state. In 1807 four colonies of Jewish agriculturists were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
established in the Government of Kherson, the first among
the Jewish colonies of South Russia. The number of settlers
amounted to some three hundred families, consisting of two
thousand souls.</p>

<p>The number of applicants desirous of settling on the land
continued to increase. In the course of 1808, when the expulsion
from the villages was in full swing, the White Russian
governors bombarded the Minister of the Interior with petitions
to allow as many Jewish families as possible to proceed
to New Russia. The Governor of Vitebsk reported that the
rural Jews</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>have been unseasonably expelled, ruined, and reduced to beggary.
A large part of them is without daily bread and without
shelter, and they emigrate in considerable numbers to New
Russia. Many Jews, in the expectation of being transplanted to
New Russia, have sold all their belongings and beg leave persistently
to go there, though it be only for a domicile.</p></div>

<p>At the same time reports from the New Russian Immigration
Bureau and from Duke Richelieu were constantly reaching
St. Petersburg. They emphasized the necessity of stemming
the tide of emigrants, in view of the fact that even the
first parties of colonists had found it difficult to establish
themselves, while the new ones could not expect to find either
huts or any other accommodations. By the beginning of 1808
the Immigration Bureau was in charge of about one thousand
colonist families, and, in addition, several thousand immigrants
who had arrived "voluntarily" were waiting for their
turn to be settled. As a result of the unaccustomed climatic
conditions and the lack of housing accommodations and provisions,
disease began to spread among the new-comers. All
these circumstances decided the Government to put a temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
stop to the settling of Jews in the New Russian colonies
(ukase of April 6, 1810).</p>

<p>The attempt to convert a part of the Jewish population
into agriculturists would undoubtedly have met with huge
success, had the Government been sufficiently prepared for
such a momentous economic transformation. Ten thousand
emigrants had already gone to New Russia, and the compact
starving masses were rushing after them. But the
Government was overwhelmed by the difficulties of the task,
and brought the whole movement to a standstill. Simultaneously
a stop was put to the expulsion from the villages in
the western Governments, which threatened to lead to an
unparalleled economic catastrophe. Thus, after many vacillations
and upheavals, the economic structure of Jewish life
was re-established on its old foundations&mdash;commerce, handicrafts,
and rural occupations.

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
THE INNER LIFE OF RUSSIAN JEWRY DURING THE
PERIOD OF "ENLIGHTENED ABSOLUTISM"</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">1. Kahal Autonomy and City Government</span></p>

<p>The system of state patronage spread its wings also over the
self-government of the Jewish communities. Towards the end
of Catherine II.'s reign the Government clearly betrayed its
tendency to curtail the extensive communal autonomy which
the Jews had been guaranteed earlier, in 1776, when the
promise of the Empress, to allow the Jews of annexed White
Russia "to retain their former liberties," was still fresh in
the official mind. But the Russian Government, not in the
habit of tolerating such "licentiousness" among its subjects,
looked askance at the large economic, spiritual, and judicial
functions granted to the Kahals, in addition to their fiscal
duties as the collecting agencies of the state taxes. As a result
of this attitude, the ukases of 1786 and 1795 had limited the
range of activity of the Kahals to spiritual and fiscal affairs.
The "Jewish Constitution" of 1804 went one step further
by dividing these two functions between the rabbinate and the
Kahals, which had previously formed one whole. The rabbis
were given permission "to look after all the ceremonies of the
Jewish faith and decide all disputes bearing on religion,"
while the Kahals were ordered "to see to the regular payment
of the state taxes." This was all that was left of the ancient
autonomy of the Jewish communities in Poland, with its vast
network of institutions and central assemblies, or Waads.</p>

<p>It is apparent that in real life the power of the communities
was larger than on paper. The Jews went on submitting most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of their cases, even those involving monetary disputes, to their
own rabbinical tribunals. The prohibition of imposing the
herem (excommunication) upon obstreperous members of
the community was occasionally disregarded, since the "spiritual"
tribunals had no other means of coercion at their
disposal. On the other hand, the Government itself, being in
need not only of the fiscal services of the Kahals, but also of
a responsible organization to be consulted upon Jewish matters,
could not help tolerating the extension of Kahal activities
far beyond the range of fiscal interests. When the Government
was desirous of ascertaining the views of the Jewish
communities on some of the measures planned by it, it
addressed itself, as was the case in 1802, 1803, and 1807,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
to the Kahals, and authorized them to send delegates to St.
Petersburg or the provincial capitals.</p>

<p>This extension of Jewish autonomy was a concession wrested
from the Government by the force of circumstances, by the
power of a compact population living a life of its own and
refusing to efface itself to the point of merging with the surrounding
population and fusing all its public interests with the
affairs of the general city administration. Yet it was just this
"municipalization" of the Jewish communities that the Russian
Government had been aiming at for a long time. From
the time of Catherine II. it cherished the thought of "destroying
Jewish separateness," by forcing the Jews into the framework
of the Russian class organization, particularly into the
estates of the merchants and burghers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>When, shortly after 1780, the Jews were accorded the
hitherto unheard-of privilege of participating in the city
government with the right of active and passive suffrage for
the magistracies and municipal courts, the lawgivers of St.
Petersburg were confident that Russian Jewry, in a transport
of delight, would throw overboard its old Kahal autonomy,
and eagerly coalesce with the Christian urban estates, to form
a common municipal organization. But neither the Jews nor
the Christians justified these confident expectations. The
former, while clinging as heretofore to their time-honored
communal organization, were glad to participate in the elections
to the magistracies, in which up till then their traditional
enemies, the Christian merchants and burghers, had been
the masters, and in which they frankly proposed to protect their
interests, representing as they did a considerable portion of the
urban population.</p>

<p>But here they encountered furious opposition on the part of
their Christian fellow-residents. In the two White Russian
Governments of Vitebsk and Moghilev several Jews had been
elected to the magistracies as aldermen and members of the
law courts. But in the majority of cases the Christians managed
to obtain an artificial majority and keep the Jews out
of the municipal administration. Complaints lodged with the
central authorities in St. Petersburg were of no avail, for the
Russian, and even more so the Polish, burghers regarded the
bestowal of municipal rights upon the Jews as a violation of
their own chartered privileges. Yielding to this mood of the
Christian population, the administrators of the southwestern
Governments established on their own responsibility a restrictive
percentage for the participation of Jews in the magistracies,
by limiting, even in places with a predominatingly
Jewish population, the number of Jewish members to be
elected to the magistracies to one-third. The representatives
of the Jewish majority of the population in the city administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
were thus invariably reduced to a minority, and were
not in a position to protect the interests of their coreligionists,
either in the assessment of the municipal taxes or in the cases
brought before the municipal law courts. Here, too, the protest
addressed to St. Petersburg by a delegate acting on behalf
of the Podolian Jews did not remedy the situation.</p>

<p>In the two Lithuanian Governments which had fallen into
the hands of Russia after the third partition of Poland, in
1795, the Christian opposition scored even a greater success.
For here it became necessary to suspend altogether the operation
of the law granting the Jews representation in the magistracies.
When the Senatorial ukase of 1802, making the
Jews eligible for public office, became known in Vilna, the
local Christian population raised a cry of indignation. The
Philistine arrogance of the old "city fathers," combined with
the low motives of religious and class hatred, manifested itself
in a petition addressed in February, 1803, by the Christian
burghers of Vilna to Alexander I.</p>

<p>In this petition the residents of Vilna protest against the
violation of their ancient privilege, in pursuance of which
"Jews and members of other faiths are forbidden to hold
office" in Lithuania. The admission of Jews to the magistracies
is a misfortune and a disgrace for the capital of Lithuania,
for</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>they [the Jews] have not the slightest conception of morality,
while their form of education does not fit them for the calling of
a judge, and altogether this people can only maintain itself by all
kinds of trickery.... The Christians will lose all interest in
accepting public office once the Jews are given the right to
dominate them.</p></div>

<p>The petitioners point out threateningly that the domination
of the Jews, <i>i. e.</i> their participation in the magistracies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
though it be limited to one-third of the number of aldermen,
will undermine the people's confidence in the municipal administration
and judiciary. "For the obedience of the mob
will be turned into defamation when the Christian who enters
the sacred place [of justice] beholds a Jew as his superior
and judge, submission to whom is unnatural, by reason of
class and religion."</p>

<p>The Christian population of Kovno resorted, in presenting
a similar petition, to another incontrovertible argument against
the admission of Jews to municipal offices. Referring to
the cross with the "sacred figure" of the crucifixion, which
is placed on the court table for the administration of the oath,
the petitioners assert that the Jewish members of the court
"will refuse to look upon it, but, by reason of their faith, will
think disrespectfully of it, so that, instead of judicial impartiality,
there will be mockery of the Christian law." The
Government found these arguments convincing, and in 1805
repealed the ukase of the Senate concerning the election of Jews
to the magistracies of Lithuania.</p>

<p>In this way the stolid rancor of the "privileged" burghers
in some places handicapped the activity of the Jews in the
city administration, and in others entirely suppressed it. The
Jewish communities, backward though they were, displayed
sufficient civic courage to send their representatives to the
camp of the enemy to work in common with him for the benefit
of the whole urban population. But the narrow-minded
burghers, who were thoroughly saturated with medieval prejudices,
would not recognize the Jews as their fellow-townsmen.
The Jews had to reckon with this coarse conservatism of the
surrounding population. They were still able to fall back upon
their own communal self-government, and, had their social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
energies been directed towards that end, the old Kahal autonomy,
in spite of all Government restrictions, might to a certain
extent have come into its own again. But another factor
thwarted this revival&mdash;the deep rift in the Russian Jewish
community, which began with the rise of Hasidism in the
second half of the eighteenth century, and was an accomplished
fact at the beginning of the nineteenth century.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">2. The Hasidic Schism and the Intervention of the
Government</span></p>

<p>The period of Poland's partitions was also a period of divisions
within Polish Jewry. The external division was accompanied
by an internal split; the political partition, by a spiritual
schism. The body of Polish Jewry was divided among Russia,
Austria, and Prussia, and its soul between Rabbinism and
Hasidism. There was even a significant coincidence in dates:
the first declaration against Hasidism by the rabbinate of
Vilna, which started the religious schism, was issued in 1772,
in the year of the first Polish partition, and the second emphatic
declaration of the same rabbinate, which completed the
schism, followed close upon the third partition of Poland, in
1796.</p>

<p>The interval between these two dates represents one continuous
stretch of Hasidic triumphs. The Russian Southwest,
Volhynia, the province of Kiev, and Podolia, had by the end of
the period, been almost completely conquered by the Hasidim.
With the exception of a few cities, they now formed the predominating
element in the communities; their ritual was
adopted in synagogue worship, and their spiritual rulers, the
Tzaddiks, exercised control over the official rabbinate. As far
as the Northwest is concerned, Hasidism had managed during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
that interval to obtain a foothold in White Russia, the only
Polish province which for over twenty years had been under
Russian dominion, and thus politically severed from the rest
of curtailed Poland. Under the leadership of the Tzaddik
Shneor Zalman of Lozno, a strong Hasidic center had been built
up in that part of the Northwest, but there were yet no compact
Hasidic communities in that region. In the majority of towns
the communities were composed of both elements, Hasidim and
their opponents, the Rabbinists, who were nicknamed <i>Mithnagdim</i>
("Protestants"), the preponderance being now on this
side, now on the other, a state of affairs which gave rise to
endless dissensions in the Kahals and synagogues.</p>

<p>In Lithuania alone, the stronghold of Rabbinism, Hasidism
failed to take root. Here a few small Hasidic groups were
ensconced in a number of cities. They held their services in
modest rooms in private residences (<i>minyanim</i>), which they
were often forced to hide from the gaze of the hostile Kahal
authorities. In Vilna, the residence of the great zealot of
Rabbinism, Elijah Gaon, the Hasidim constituted an "illegal"
secret organization. Only in the suburb of Pinsk, in Karlin,
the Hasidim succeeded in establishing themselves firmly, and
could boast of having their own synagogues and Tzaddiks.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
Karlin became the seat of a Hasidic propaganda extending all
over Lithuania, where the Hasidim were accordingly nicknamed
"Karliners."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>The second and third partition of Poland, which united
Lithuania and White Russia under the sovereignty of Russia,
tended to buoy up the oppressed Lithuanian Hasidim, who
could now join forces against the common enemy with their
brethren all over the northwestern region. The Hasidic propaganda
took on new courage. To enhance the success of their
missionary activity, the Hasidim spread a rumor, that the
former anti-Hasidic thunderer, the veteran Rabbi Elijah Gaon,
was sorry for all the hostile acts he had committed against the
sectarians, and that in consequence the excommunication formerly
hurled by him against them was no longer valid. When
this clever ruse became known in Vilna, the indignant champions
of Rabbinism prompted the aged Gaon to publish an
epistle in which he reaffirmed his former attitude towards the
"heretics," and declared that all the herems previously issued
against them remained in force (May, 1796). The epistle was
intrusted to two envoys, who were dispatched from Vilna to a
number of cities, for the purpose of stirring up an anti-Hasidic
agitation. When the envoys arrived in Minsk, and set about
executing their instructions, the Hasidim started a rumor to
the effect that the Gaon's signature under the epistle was not
genuine. The Kahal of Minsk sent an inquiry to Vilna, and in
reply received, in September, 1796, a new energetic appeal of
the Gaon addressed to all the gubernatorial Kahals of Lithuania,
White Russia, Volhynia, and Podolia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ye mountains of Israel&mdash;cried the great zealot&mdash;ye spiritual
shepherds, and ye lay leaders of every Government, also ye, the
heads of the Kahals of Moghilev, Polotzk, Zhitomir, Vinnitza, and
Kamenetz-Podolsk, you hold in your hands a hammer wherewith
you may shatter the plotters of evil, the enemies of light, the
foes of the [Jewish] people. Woe unto this generation! They
[the Hasidim] violate the Law, distort our teachings, and set up
a new covenant; they lay snares in the house of the Lord, and
give a perverted exposition of the tenets of our faith. It behooves
us to avenge the Law of the Lord, it behooves us to punish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>these madmen before the whole world, for their own improvement.
Let none have pity on them and grant them shelter!... Gird
yourselves with zeal in the name of the Lord!</p></div>

<p>In calling to arms against the Hasidim in these fulminant
terms, the venerable knight of Rabbinism was moved by the
profound conviction that the "new sect," which by that time
numbered its adherents by the hundreds of thousands, was
leading the Jewish religion and nation to ruin, because it
was rending asunder the Jewish camp internally while the
political upheavals were severing it externally. He was moreover
alarmed by the luxuriant growth of the cult of the
Tzaddiks, or miracle-workers, which constituted a menace to
the purity of the Jewish doctrine.</p>

<p>The Gaon's ire was particularly aroused by a work published
in the same year as his epistle (1796), by Rabbi Shneor
Zalman, the head of the White Russian Hasidim. The work
was familiarly called <i>Tanyo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> and contained a bold exposition
of the pantheistic doctrine of Hasidism, which the champions
of the established dogma were prone to regard as blasphemy
and heresy.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The Gaon's proclamation hinted at this work, and
its author felt painfully hurt by the attack. Shneor Zalman
responded in a counter-epistle, in which he tried to prove that
the patriarch of Rabbinism had been misinformed about the
true essence of Hasidism, and he invited his opponent to a
literary dispute for the purpose of elucidating the truth and
"restoring peace in Israel." But the Gaon refused to enter
into polemics with a "heretic." In the meantime the Vilna
epistle continued to circulate in many communities, and gave
rise to severe conflicts between Mithnagdim and Hasidim, the
former as a rule taking the offensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>Exasperated to the point of madness by these persecutions,
the Hasidic association of Vilna was stung into perpetrating
an act of gross tactlessness. When, in the fall of 1797, about a
year after the publication of his last circular, the aged Gaon
closed his eyes, and the whole community of Vilna was plunged
into mourning, the local Hasidic society met in a private house
and indulged in a gay drinking bout, to celebrate the deliverance
of the sect from its principal enemy. This ugly demonstration
arranged on the day of the funeral raised a storm of
indignation throughout the community. Before leaving the
cemetery, the leaders of the community, standing at the Gaon's
grave, pledged themselves solemnly to wreak vengeance upon
the Hasidim. On the following day the Kahal elders were
called to a special meeting, at which a series of repressive
measures against the Hasidim was adopted. Apart from the
measures to be made public, such as a new bull of excommunication
against the sectarians, the meeting passed several
resolutions which were to remain confidential. A special
committee of five Kahal members was appointed, and was
vested with large powers, for the purpose of grappling with the
"heresy." Subsequent events proved that among the contemplated
means of warfare was included the plan of informing
against the leaders of the sect to the Russian Government.</p>

<p>It did not take long for the disgraceful scheme to be put
into action. Soon the Prosecutor-General in St. Petersburg,
Lopukhin, received a denunciation directing his attention "to
the political misdeeds perpetrated by the chief of the Karliner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
[Hasidic] sect, Zalman Borukhovich [son of Borukh]," and
his fellow-workers in Lithuania. Under the influence of this
denunciation, Lopukhin, acting in the name of the Tzar,
ordered the local gubernatorial administration, early in the fall
of 1798, to arrest Zalman, the head of the sect, in the townlet of
Lozno, together with twenty-two of his accomplices who were
found in Lithuania. Zalman was apprehended and dispatched
post-haste to St. Petersburg, accompanied by "a strong convoy";
his incriminated followers remained under arrest in
Vilna.</p>

<p>Zalman was arraigned before the so-called "Secret Expedition,"
a department which dealt with crimes of a political
nature. A long bill of indictments was read out to him. He
was accused of being the founder of a harmful religious sect,
which had changed the order of divine service among Jews,
of spreading pernicious ideas, and collecting funds for mysterious
purposes in Palestine. The cross-examination clearly
implied the charge of <i>political</i> disloyalty. To all questions
laid before him, the accused gave an elaborate written reply
in Hebrew. Zalman's defense, which was translated from
the Hebrew into Russian, produced a favorable impression in
Government circles. Acting upon the report submitted to him
by the Prosecutor-General respecting "all the circumstances
revealed by the investigation," Tzar Paul I. issued an order
to liberate Zalman and the other sectarian chiefs who had been
placed under arrest, but to keep "a strict watch over them as
to whether there exists, or is liable to come into existence, a
secret relationship or correspondence between them and those
who entertain perverted notions concerning the authorities and
the form of Government." Towards the end of 1798 Zalman
was allowed to return home, and the other prisoners were likewise
set at liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it was the turn of the Hasidim to retaliate on their
persecutors. In view of the fact that the persecutions against
them had been instigated by the Kahal elders of Vilna, who
had composed the "Committee of Five," the Hasidim made
up their mind to depose these elders and put their own partisans
in their places. With the help of bakhshish the Vilna
Hasidim managed to secure the good-will of the gubernatorial
administration. In the beginning of 1799 they lodged a complaint
with the local authorities against the Kahal elders,
charging them with having perpetrated all kinds of abuses,
including the embezzlement of public funds. This action resulted
in the removal and imprisonment of several elders.
Under official pressure their places were filled by new elders,
who either were themselves Hasidim or had been recommended
by them. The community of Vilna was rent in twain.
One section remained true to the dismissed elders, the other
stood up for the newly-elected. The warring factions were
busy sending complaints and denunciations directed against
each other to the Government in St. Petersburg. The canker
of "informing," which, perhaps not accidentally, had developed
in the first years of Russian rule in Lithuania,
brought to the front one hideous personality, a rabbi-informer
by the name of Avigdor Haïmovich (son of Hayyim), of Pinsk.</p>

<p>Avigdor, formerly rabbi of Pinsk and the surrounding
district, had been dismissed from office owing to the intrigues
of the Hasidic members of the community, who were his
opponents. What Avigdor lamented most was the loss of
revenue. For a long time the dethroned shepherd had been
dragging his flock through the magistracies and law courts.
Having failed in his efforts, he decided to wreak vengeance
upon the leader of the sect responsible for his ruin. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
the beginning of 1800 Avigdor addressed an elaborate petition
to Tzar Paul I., in which he described the Hasidic sect
as "a pernicious and dangerous organization," which was continuing
the work of the former Messianic Sabbatians. By a
vast array of distorted quotations from Hasidic literature the
informer endeavored to prove that the teachers of the sect
enjoined upon their followers to fear only God and not men,
in other words, to disregard the authorities, including the Tzar.</p>

<p>The denunciation was allowed to take its course. Early in
November of the same year, the Tzaddik Zalman Borukhovich
was rearrested in Lozno and dispatched to St. Petersburg
under the convoy of two Senatorial couriers. On his arrival
in the capital the Tzaddik was incarcerated in the fortress,
and after a cross-examination confronted with his accuser
Avigdor. Zalman again replied in writing to the indictments
against him, which now mounted up to nineteen counts. He
repudiated emphatically the charge of not recognizing the
authority of the Government, of immorality, of collecting
money, and arranging meetings for secret purposes. Towards
the end of November Zalman was set at liberty, but was
ordered to remain in St. Petersburg pending the examination
of his case by the Senate, to which it had now been transferred
from the Secret Expedition. While the Senate was preparing
to take up the case, the palace revolution of March, 1801, cut
short Paul's reign, and placed Alexander I. upon the throne.
The political wind veered round, and on March 29, 1801, the
new Tzar gave Zalman permission to depart from St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Having satisfied itself that the religious schism in Judaism
was perfectly harmless from the political point of view,
the Government was ready to give it its sanction. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
clauses of the Statute of 1804 permits the sectarians to establish
their own synagogues in every community and to elect
their own rabbis, with the sole stipulation that the Kahal
administration in each city shall remain one and the same
for all sections of the community. As a matter of fact, the
law merely recognized what had already become the living
practice. The religious split had long been an accomplished
fact, and the internecine strife of 1796-1801 was merely its
final act. As for the communal organization of the Jews, which
had already been undermined by the political changes, the
schism proved nothing short of disastrous. The Kahals, weakened
by inner struggles and demoralized by denunciations and
bureaucratic interference, failed to present a united front in the
first years of Alexander's reign, when the Government was
carrying out its "plan of reform," and invited the Kahal
leaders to share in its labors. The communities of the Southwest,
which were completely under the ban of Hasidic mysticism,
reacted feebly to the social and economic crisis facing
them. The Jewish delegates who presented their views in reply
to the official inquiries of 1803 and 1807<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> were recruited principally
from the White Russian and Lithuanian Governments,
where the political sense of the Jews had not yet been completely
dulled.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">3. Rabbinism, Hasidism, and Enlightened
"Berlinerdom"</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>While in Western Europe the old forms of Jewish life were
breaking up, the cultural development of the Jewish masses
of Eastern Europe remained stationary. The two dominating
forces in their spiritual life, Rabbinism and Hasidism, watched
with equal zeal over the maintenance of the old order of things.
The traditional form of education remained unchanged. The
old school, the heder and yeshibah, with its exclusive Talmudic
training, supplied its pupils with a vast amount of mental
energy, but failed to prepare them for practical life, and the
girls and women remained entirely outside the influence of the
school. Just as firmly established was the old-fashioned scheme
of family life, with its early marriages, between the years of
thirteen and sixteen, with the prolonged maintenance of such
married children in the paternal home, with its excessive fertility
in the midst of habitual poverty, with its reduction of
physical wants to the point of exhaustion and degeneration.
This patriarchal mass of Jews fought shy of all cultural
"novelties," and deprecated the slightest attempt to extend its
mental and social horizon. Religious culture had not yet had a
chance to cross swords with secular culture. The war between
Hasidism and Rabbinism was fought on purely religious soil.
Its sole issue was the <i>type</i> of the believer: the old discipline
with its emphasis upon the scholastic and ceremonial aspect of
Judaism was fighting against the onrush of ecstatic mysticism
and the blind "cult of saints."</p>

<p>It cannot be said that benumbed Rabbinism revived under
the effect of this vehement contest. At the time we are speaking
of no distinct traces of such a revival are to be seen, and all
one can discern are the signs of a purely scholastic renaissance.
The method of textual analysis introduced by Elijah Gaon into
Talmudic research, which took the place of the hair-splitting
casuistry formerly in vogue, gained ever wider currency and
an ever firmer foothold in the yeshibahs of Lithuania.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>In the new center of Talmudic learning, the yeshibah of
the Lithuanian townlet of Volozhin,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> established in 1803, this
novel method received particular attention at the hands of its
founder, Rabbi Hayyim Volozhiner, a pupil of the Gaon. The
yeshibah of Volozhin raised a whole generation of scholars and
rabbis "in the spirit of the Gaon." In these circles one could
even detect a certain amount of toleration towards the anathematized
"secular sciences," though this toleration was limited
to the realm of mathematics and partly that of natural history.
The Gaon, who had himself engaged in mathematical exercises
in his spare moments, permitted his pupil Borukh Shklover
to publish a Hebrew translation of Euclid's Geometry (1780).
Yet the dread of philosophy was as great as theretofore,
and the incompatibility of free research with Judaism was
looked upon as an inviolable dogma. The Jewish mind continued
to move within the narrow range of "the four ells of the
Halakha," and was doomed to sterility. In the course of that
whole stormy period, extending over a quarter of a century,
Rabbinism, aside from the Gaon, had not put forward a single
literary figure of any magnitude, not a single writer of large
vision. It seemed as if the spirit of originality had fled from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>Greater productivity was to be found among the Hasidim of
the period, although in point of originality it yielded considerably
to the preceding era of the Besht and his first apostles.
Alongside of triumphant practical Tzaddikism, trading in miracles
and thriving on the credulity of the masses, we observe to
a certain degree the continued development of the Hasidic
doctrine on the lines laid down by Besht. In the North a new
Hasidic theory was spreading, which strove to adapt the
emotional pietism of Besht to the "intellectualism" of the
Lithuanian schoolmen. The originator of this doctrine, Rabbi
Shneor Zalman, the hero of the religious struggle depicted in
the foregoing chapters, endeavored to rationalize Hasidism,
which had manifested a decided leaning toward the principle
<i>credo quia absurdum sit</i>. In the hands of the author of
<i>Tanyo</i>, the ecstasy of feeling is transformed into ecstasy of
thinking. Occasionally he speaks of the knowledge of God in
terms worthy of a Maimonides. Needless to say, Rabbi Zalman
rejects the Tzaddik cult in the vulgar form of miracle-mongering,
which it had assumed in the South.</p>

<p>In the South&mdash;to speak more exactly, in the Ukraina&mdash;Hasidism
persisted in the beaten track. Its two pillars, Levi
Itzhok (Isaac) of Berdychev (died 1809) and Nohum
(Nahum) of Chernobyl (died 1799), continued to uphold
Besht's traditions. The former, the author of <i>Kedushath Levi</i><a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
(1798), manifests in his work the genuine fervor of Hasidic
faith, without its morbid ecstasy. In his private life this leader
of Volhynian Hasidism was the embodiment of lovingkindness,
extending alike to Jew and non-Jew. Many popular legends
tell of his surpassing affection for the humble and suffering.
The Tzaddik Nohum of Chernobyl, who was an itinerant
preacher in the Government of Kiev, laid in his sermons special
emphasis on the element of the Cabala. Towards the end of
his life he was primarily a Tzaddik, of the "practitioner" and
"miracle-worker" type, and founded the "Chernobyl Tzaddik
dynasty," which is still widely ramified in the Ukraina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>Quite apart from the rest stands the figure of the Podolian
Tzaddik and dreamer Nahman of Bratzlav (1772-1810), a
great-grandson of Besht. Gifted with a profoundly poetical
disposition, he spurned the beaten tracks of the professional
"Righteous," and struck out into a path of his own. The goal
he aimed at was the return to the childlike simplicity of
Besht's teachings. In 1798-1799 Nahman made a pilgrimage
to Palestine, just about the time when Bonaparte's army was
marching through the Holy Land, and a gust from tempestuous
Europe drifted through the slumbering East. But the Podolian
youth had an ear only for the whisper from the tombs
of the great Cabalist teachers, Rabbi Shimeon ben Yohai and
Ari, and for the discourses of the living Tzaddiks who had settled
in Tiberias. On his return to Europe, Nahman made his
home in Bratzlav, and became the head of a group of Podolian
Hasidim. In his intimate circle he was wont to preach, or
rather to muse aloud, on the reign of the spirit, on the communion
of the Tzaddik with his flock in religious ecstasy. He
spoke in epigrams, sometimes clothing his thoughts in the
form of folk-tales. He wrote a number of books,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> in which he
constantly emphasized the need of blind, unsophisticated faith.
Philosophy he regarded as destructive to the soul; Maimonides
and the rationalists were hateful to him. The unfamiliar
Berlin "enlightenment" filled his heart with mysterious awe.
Nahman's life was cut short prematurely. Surrounded by
his admirers, he died of consumption, in Uman, at the age of
thirty-eight. Down to this day his grave serves as a place of
pilgrimage for the "Bratzlav Hasidim."</p>

<p>However, the average Tzaddik of the type which had assumed
definite shape in that period was equally removed from
the complexity of Rabbi Zalman and the simplicity of Rabbi
Nahman. On the whole, the Tzaddiks drifted further and
further away from their mission of religious teachers, and
became more and more "practitioners." Surrounded by a
host of enthusiastic worshipers, these "middlemen between
God and mankind" understood the art of turning the blind
faith of the masses to good account. They waxed rich on the
gifts and offerings of their admirers, lived in palaces, much
after the manner of the Polish magnates and Church dignitaries.
The "court" of Besht's grandson in Medzhibozh,
Borukh Tulchinski (1780-1810), was marked by particular
splendor. Borukh even had his court-fool, Herschel Ostropoler,
the well-known hero of popular anecdotes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>In the original Polish provinces, afterwards incorporated
into the Duchy of Warsaw, the commanders-in-chief of the
Hasidic army were two Tzaddiks, Rabbi Israel of Kozhenitz
and Rabbi Jacob Itzhok (Isaac) of Lublin. These two pupils
of the "apostle" Baer of Mezherich became the pioneers of
Hasidism on the banks of the Vistula towards the end of the
eighteenth century. At the close of their careers&mdash;both died in
1815&mdash;the banner of Hasidism floated over the whole of
Poland.</p>

<p>The breezes of Western culture had hardly a chance to penetrate
to this realm, protected as it was by the double wall of
Rabbinism and Hasidism. And yet here and there one may
discern on the surface of social life the foam of the wave from
the far-off West. From Germany the free-minded "Berliner,"
the nickname applied to these "new men," was moving towards
the borders of Russia. He arrayed himself in a short
German coat, cut off his earlocks, shaved his beard, neglected
the religious observances, spoke German or "the language of
the land," and swore by the name of Moses Mendelssohn. The
culture of which he was the banner-bearer was a rather shallow
enlightenment, which affected exterior and form rather than
mind and heart. It was "Berlinerdom," the harbinger of the
more complicated Haskala of the following period, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
imported into Warsaw during the decade of Prussian dominion
(1796-1806). The contact between the capitals of Poland and
Prussia yielded its fruits. The Jewish "dandy" of Berlin
appeared on the streets of Warsaw, and not infrequently the
long robe of the Polish Hasid made way timidly for the
German coat, the symbol of "enlightenment."</p>

<p>Alongside of this external assimilation, attempts were also
made to copy the literary models of Prussian Jewry. In 1796
a Jewish Mendelssohnian named Jacques Kalmansohn published
a French pamphlet in Warsaw, under the title <i>Essai sur
l'état actuel des Juifs de Pologne et leur perfectibilité</i>, dedicating
it to the Prussian Minister Hoym, who had carried out
Jewish reforms in the Polish provinces of Prussia. The
pamphlet contains an account of the status of Polish Jewry
of his time and a plan for its amelioration. The account is
rather superficial, concocted after the approved Western
recipe. In the judgment of the author, the misfortune of the
Jews lies in their separation from the surrounding nations,
and their happiness in merging with them. The scheme of
reform proposed by the Jew Kalmansohn differs but slightly
from the Polish projects of Butrymovich and Chatzki. It
advocates equally the weakening of rabbinical and Kahal
authority, the extermination of Hasidism and Tzaddikism,
the introduction of German dress, the shaving of beards, the
establishment of German schools, and in general the cultivation
of "civism."</p>

<p>The mould of Berlin fashion was overlaid with a Parisian
veneer when soon afterwards (1807-1812), at the bidding of
Napoleon, the Duchy of Warsaw sprang into being. Now a
new note was sounded. A group of Parisian "dandies" claim
equal rights as a compensation for having changed their dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
and their "moral conduct."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Even respectable representatives
of the Warsaw Jewish community designate themselves in their
petition to the Senate as "members of the Polish nation of the
Mosaic persuasion," copying the latest Parisian fashion, in
vogue at the time of the Napoleonic Synhedrion.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> This was
the first, though as yet naïve and unsophisticated, attempt to
secure the "transfer" from the Jewish nation to the Polish, the
germ of the future "Poles of the Old Testament persuasion."</p>

<p>The torch-bearers of Berlin culture from among the followers
of David Friedländer encouraged this frame of mind in every
possible manner, and in their organ<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> constantly appealed in
this spirit to their Polish brethren.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How long will you continue&mdash;one of these appeals reads&mdash;to speak
a corrupt German dialect [Yiddish] instead of the language of
your country, the Polish? How many misfortunes might have
been averted by your forefathers, had they been able to express
themselves adequately in the Polish tongue before the magnates
and kings! Take a group of a hundred Jews in Germany, and
you will find that either all or most of them can speak to the
magnates and rulers, but in Poland scarcely five or ten out of a
hundred are capable of doing so.</p></div>

<p>Some stray seeds of Western "enlightenment" were carried
as far as the distant Russian North. During Dyerzhavin's tour
of inspection through White Russia there flitted across his
vision the figure of the physician Frank in Kreslavka, an
avowed follower of Mendelssohn, calling for religious and educational
reforms.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> In St. Petersburg, in the house of the
Maecenas Abraham Peretz, lived his teacher Judah Leib Nyevakhovich,
a native of Podolia. In 1803, the same year in which
the Jewish deputies sojourned in St. Petersburg, Nyevakhovich
published a pamphlet in Russian, under the title, "The Wailing
of the Daughter of Judah," with a dedication to Kochubay, the
Minister of the Interior and Chairman of the "Jewish Committee."
The dedication strikes the keynote of the "Wailing":
genuflexion before the greatness of Russia and mortification
at the fate of his coreligionists, who are deprived of their
share in the "blessings" of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>"How greatly," exclaims the author, "doth my soul exult
over these matters [the victories and might of the Russian
Empire]; how deeply doth it grieve over my coreligionists,
who are removed from the hearts of their compatriots."
And throughout the whole of the pamphlet the "Daughter
of Judah" bewails the fact that neither the eighteenth century,
"the age of humanity, toleration, and meekness," nor
"the smiling spring of the present century, the beginning of
which hath been crowned ... by the accession of Alexander
the Merciful, has removed the deep-seated Jewish hatred in
Russia." "Many minds doom the tribe of Judah to contempt.
The name 'Judean' hath become an object of ridicule, contempt,
and scorn for children and the feeble-minded." With
particular reference to Mendelssohn and Lessing the author
exclaims: "You search for the Jew in man. Search for man
in the Jew, and you will no doubt find him."</p>

<p>Nyevakhovich's pamphlet concludes with a grievous moan:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While the hearts of all the European nations have drawn nearer
to one another, the Jewish people still finds itself despised. I feel
the full weight of this torment. I appeal to all who have sympathy
and compassion. Why do you sentence my entire people to contempt?
Thus waileth sadly the daughter of Judah, wiping her
tears, sighing and yet uncomforted.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>The author himself, by the way, subsequently managed to
obtain comfort. A few years after the publication of the
"Wailing," still finding himself "removed from the hearts of
his compatriots," he discovered the magic key to these obstreperous
hearts. He embraced Christianity, and, transformed into
Lev Alexandrovich Nyevakhovich, began to write moralizing
Russian plays, which pleased the unsophisticated taste of the
Russian public of the day. Nyevakhovich thus carried his
"Berlinerdom" to that dramatic <i>dénouement</i> which was in
fashion in Berlin itself, where an epidemic of baptism was raging.
His example was followed by his patron Abraham Peretz,
who had been ruined in the War of 1812 by military contracts.
The descendants of both converts occupied important posts in
the Russian civil service. One of the Peretz family was a member
of the Council of State during the reign of Alexander II.</p>

<p>A faint reflection of the Western literature of enlightenment
is visible during this period on the somber horizon of
Russia. Mendel Lewin, of Satanov<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> (1741-1819), who had
been privileged to behold in the flesh the Father of Enlightenment
in Berlin, scattered new seeds in his native country.
He translated into Hebrew the popular manual of medicine by
Tissot, the moral philosophy of Franklin, and the books of
travel by Campe. He also made an attempt to render the Book
of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes into the vernacular Yiddish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>The last undertaking drew upon Lewin the wrath of another
"enlightened" writer, Tobias Feder of Piotrkov and Berdychev
(died 1817), who attacked him savagely for "profaning"
Holy Writ by turning it into the "language of the street."
Feder himself published studies in Hebrew grammar and
Biblical exegesis, moralizing treatises, harmless satires, and
poetical odes. These publications cannot be said to mark an
epoch in the realm of literature, but they undoubtedly symbolize
a new departure in cultural life. The secular book, of which
the mere appearance was apt to arouse a murmur of discontent
among the alarmed Orthodox, takes its place side by side with
the religious literature of Rabbinism and Hasidism. These
literary attempts were the harbingers of the subsequent secularization
of Hebrew literature.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
THE LAST YEARS OF ALEXANDER I.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">1. "The Deputation of the Jewish People"</span></p>

<p>The great reaction of 1815-1848, which kept the whole of
Europe in its throes, assumed peculiar forms in Russia. Tzar
Alexander I., one of the triumvirs of the Holy Alliance, which
had given birth to this reaction, was eager to atone for the
liberal "sins" of his youth, and was cultivating in Russia the
principles of "paternal administration" and "Christian
government." The last decade of his reign paved the way
for the iron-handed absolutism of Nicholas I., which fettered
the political and social life of Russia for thirty years, and
stood like an ominous specter of medievalism before the eyes of
Western Europe.</p>

<p>The destinies of the great monarchy of the East determined
those of the greatest Jewish center of the Diaspora. The
Vienna Congress of 1815 enlarged the borders of European
Russia by including in it almost the entire territory of the
former Duchy of Warsaw, which was renamed "Kingdom
of Poland."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> About two million Jews were huddled together
on the western strip of the Russian monarchy during the
period of 1815-1848,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> and this immense, sharply marked population
served as the subject of all possible experiments, which
assumed the coloring of the general Russian politics of the time.
The last years of Alexander I. inaugurate the period of patronage
and oppression, which reached its culmination in the
following reign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>The attitude of the Russian Government towards the Jews
during that period reflects three successive tendencies: first,
in the last years of Alexander I.'s reign (1815-1825), a mixed
tendency of "benevolent paternalism" and severe restrictions;
second, during the first half of Nicholas I.'s reign (1826-1840),
a military tendency, that of "correcting" the Jews by subjecting
their youth, from the age of childhood, to the austere
discipline of conscription and barrack training, accompanied
by compulsory religious assimilation and by an unprecedented
recrudescence of rightlessness and oppression; and third,
during the latter part of Nicholas's reign (1840-1855), the
"enlightened" tendency of improving the Jews by establishing
"crown schools" and demolishing the autonomous structure
of Jewish life, while keeping in force the former cruel
disabilities (1840-1855). This endless "correctional" and
"educational" experimenting on a whole people, aggravated
by the resuscitation of ritual murder trials and wholesale
expulsions in approved medieval style, makes the history of
Russian Jews during that period an uninterrupted tragedy.</p>

<p>The beginning of the period did not seem to portend evil.
Emperor Alexander returned from the Vienna Congress without
harboring aggressive plans against the Jews. On the contrary,
he remembered the patriotic services rendered by the
Jews in 1812 and the promise given by him at Bruchsal "to
ameliorate their condition."<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> As a matter of fact, several
steps were taken which seemed to point in the direction of
improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>The first manifestations of this tendency were certain administrative
changes in the management of Jewish affairs.
The ukase of January 18, 1817, ordered the Senate to submit
all matters affecting the Jewish communes, with the exception
of legal cases, to the General Manager of the Spiritual Affairs
of Foreign Denominations, a post occupied by Golitzin, the
Tzar's associate in Christian pietism and mystical infatuation.
Later in the same year, the combined Ministry of Ecclesiastic
Affairs and Public Instruction was organized, under the
guidance of Golitzin, symbolizing, as it were, the establishment
of public instruction upon the foundations of "Christian
piety." The charter of the new organization distinctly provides
that all "Jewish matters in charge of the Senate and the
Ministers" are to be transmitted to the head of the new
Ministry. In this manner the Jewish question was officially
connected with the department of ecclesiastic affairs, which
at that time occupied a central place in the administration.</p>

<p>The departmental change was followed by a more substantial
reform. The Government recognized the necessity of establishing
at the Ministry of Ecclesiastic Affairs a permanent advisory
council composed of elected Jewish representatives or
"deputies of the Jewish communes." The project was suggested
by the ephemeral and accidental endeavors in the way of
popular Jewish representation on the part of the two purveyors,
Sonnenberg and Dillon, who were attached to the headquarters
of the Russian army during the campaign of 1812. At the
audience at which Alexander I. gave these deputies the assurance
that the condition of their coreligionists would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
improved,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> they were also told to appear in the capital after
the conclusion of the war for the purpose of acquainting
the Kahals with the plans of the Government. The deputies
accordingly appeared in St. Petersburg, and entered upon
their duties as Jewish spokesmen, which they exercised during
1816 and 1817. They realized, however, that they had no right
to regard themselves as the accredited representatives of the
Jewish communities of Russia, and therefore appealed to the
Government&mdash;Sonnenberg was particularly active in this direction&mdash;to
instruct all the Kahals to elect a complete group of
deputies in due form. The Government having agreed to the
proposal, a clause was included in the instructions to the newly-established
Ministry of Ecclesiastic Affairs, to the effect that
"the [names of the] deputies of the Jewish communes shall
after their election be submitted by the Minister to his Majesty
for ratification."</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1815 all the large Kahals received orders
from the governors to choose an electoral college, two electors
for each Government. In August, 1818, the twenty-two electors
chosen from eleven Governments assembled in Vilna to
elect from their own midst three deputies and an equal number
of substitutes. The choice fell, apart from the former deputies
Sonnenberg and Dillon, on Michael Eisenstadt, Benish Lapkovski,
and Marcus Veitelson, all from the Government of
Vitebsk, and Samuel Epstein from the Government of Vilna.
To provide for the expenses of the deputies, who were to live in
St. Petersburg, the Vilna conference issued an appeal to all
Jewish communities calling upon them to make an "embroidery
collection," <i>i. e.</i> to cut off and convert into cash the
embroidered collars which well-to-do Jews attached to their
"Kittels" (shrouds worn beneath the prayer shawls on the
Day of Atonement), though the alternative of donating their
value in money was allowed. The Jews, who had been ruined
during the war, were evidently not in a position to tax themselves
directly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>Soon afterwards followed the establishment of a special
department, which was placed at the service of "the Deputation
of the Jewish People," the name by which this college of deputies,
presided over by the energetic Sonnenberg, was frequently
designated. The "college," either as a whole or through its
individual members, labored for seven years (1818-1825), but
its activity was too limited to justify the expectations of
Russian Jewry. The hope of the deputies, that they would be
consulted about the general problems bearing on the proposed
amelioration of Jewish conditions, failed to materialize. On
the contrary, the Government had in the meantime abandoned
all thought of legislative reforms, and a little later even began
to contrive ways and means of carrying into effect the restrictive
clauses of the Statute of 1804, which had been suspended
in its operation by the War of 1812.</p>

<p>The deputies, who resided in St. Petersburg and did a great
deal of lobbying, frequently managed in their intercourse with
the officials to ferret out these "designs" of the authorities
and to communicate their findings secretly to the Kahal
leaders in the provinces. At the same time they endeavored
of their own accord to avert the danger by personal negotiations
with the leading officials. While reporting on the one hand to
the Kahals, the deputies on the other hand transmitted to Golitzin,
the Minister of Ecclesiastic Affairs, the petitions of the
Kahals and their complaints against the local administration.
The deputies were thus reduced, by the force of circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
to mere go-betweens in Jewish matters. In exercising this
function, some of them, Sonnenberg in particular, were indefatigable.
They tried the patience of the high officials with
their petitions and representations, and on one occasion Sonnenberg
was even deprived of his post of deputy for "impertinent
conduct towards the authorities." The bureaucracy of
St. Petersburg began to resent these endless solicitations and
this constant meddling with their plans.</p>

<p>Gradually the deputies themselves lost heart, having realized
their impotence in grappling with the rising wave of reaction.
Some of them left St. Petersburg altogether. The downfall of
Golitzin's Ministry of Ecclesiastic Affairs, which had been
undermined by the ultra-reactionary Arakcheyev party,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> involved,
as a natural consequence, the downfall of the curious
Jewish representation affiliated with it. Golitzin's successor
as Minister of Public Instruction, the obscurantist Shishkov,
made representations to the Tzar concerning the necessity of
abolishing the institution of Jewish deputies, "numerous
instances having demonstrated that their stay here is not
only unnecessary and useless but even very harmful, inasmuch
as, under the pretext of working for the public interest, they
collect money from the Jews for no purpose, and prematurely
advertise the decisions and even the intentions of the Government."
In 1825 the "Deputation of the Jewish People" was
abolished. Thus ended an organization beautifully conceived,
but mutilated in execution, one that might well have served as a
substitute for Jewish communal representation, and might have
softened the <i>régime</i> of caprice and blighting patronage which
ate deeper and deeper into the vitals of Russian politics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span><span class="smcap">2. Christianizing Endeavors</span></p>

<p>It was quite in harmony with the spirit of the new era that
the solicitude of the Russian Government for the Jews should
have manifested itself in an attempt at saving their souls.
Christian pietism was the fashion of the day, and Alexander I.
and Golitzin, the Minister of Ecclesiastic Affairs, both of whom
were mystically inclined, conceived the idea of becoming the
instruments of Divine Providence in converting the Jews to
Christianity. Golitzin, who was the president of the Russian
Bible Society, and was anxious to make it a faithful copy of
its English model, the Missionary Bible Society of London,
approached the missionary problem in his own way. On March
25, 1817, the Tzar published an ukase calling for the formation
of a "Society of Israelitish Christians," for the purpose of
assisting Jews already converted or preparing for conversion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have learned&mdash;the ukase reads&mdash;of the difficult situation of
those Jews who, having by Divine Grace perceived the light of
Christian truth, have embraced the same, or are making ready to
join the flock of the good Shepherd and the Savior of souls. These
Jews, whom the Christian religion has severed from their brethren
in the flesh, lose every means of contact with them, and not only
have forfeited every claim to their assistance, but are also exposed
to all kinds of persecutions and oppressions on their part. Nor
do they readily find shelter among Christians, their new brethren
in the faith, to whom they are as yet unknown.... For this
reason we, taking to heart the fate of the Jews converted to Christianity,
and prompted by reverent obedience to the <i>Voice of Bliss
which calleth unto the scattered sheep of Israel to join the faith
of Christ</i>, have deemed it right to adopt measures for their welfare.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>The "welfare" held out to the converts was of a rather
substantial nature. Each of their groups was to be allotted
free crown lands in the southern and northern provinces, with
the right of founding all kinds of settlements, townlets, and
cities. They were to be granted full civil equality, extensive
communal self-government, and special alleviations in the payment
of taxes. These groups, or colonies, of Jews, after being
converted to the Greek Orthodox, Catholic, or Lutheran faith,
were to form part of the "Society of Israelitish Christians,"
which was to be managed by a special committee to be appointed
in St. Petersburg under the patronage of the Emperor.
The solemn phraseology of the Imperial ukase shows unequivocally
that the Government was not satisfied with the modest
task of rendering assistance to occasional neophytes. It was
ready to embark upon a vast undertaking, that of encouraging
baptism among the Jewish population, and organizing the converted
masses into separate, privileged communes, to serve as a
bait for the Jews still languishing in their old beliefs. The
imagination of the Russian legislators pictured to them the
fascinating spectacle of huge masses of Jews marching "to
join the faith of Christ," drawn to it not only by heavenly, but
also by earthly, "bliss."</p>

<p>The missionary mood of the heads of the Russian Government
was speedily utilized by Lewis Way, a representative of the
London Bible Society. Way was thoroughly imbued with the
apocalyptic belief in the approaching redemption of Israel
under the ægis of Christianity. This however did not prevent
him from looking upon present-day unconverted Israel with
sentiments of profound respect, as the banner-bearer of a great
Divine mission in the history of mankind, and he was deeply
aroused over the civil disabilities to which they were subjected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
in the various countries of Europe. When the monarchs who
had concluded the Holy Alliance assembled, in the autumn of
1818, with their ministers and diplomats at the Congress in
Aix-la-Chapelle, Way grasped the occasion to submit to Alexander
I. a "Memorandum Concerning the Condition of the
Jews,"<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> in which he appealed to the Russian Tzar to emancipate
the Jews of his dominions and persuade the Prussian and
Austrian rulers to do likewise.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the course of my protracted travels through the lands of
Poland, for the purpose of gathering information about the Jews,
I came&mdash;says Way&mdash;to the conclusion that Providence has not in
vain placed so many thousands of Jews under the protection of
three Christian sovereigns. Rather has this taken place in fulfilment
of the promises given to the Patriarchs.</p></div>

<p>If the Jews are to join the flock of Christ, they ought to be
treated like children, and regarded as equal members of human
society. Captive Israel must be set free materially, before it
can be liberated spiritually. Way therefore implores the Russian
Tzar to set the example, "which will produce its effect
upon the whole world."</p>

<p>The Tzar received Way's memorandum, and turned it over to
Nesselrode, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, with instructions
to submit it to the Congress for consideration. At a meeting
of Ministers-Plenipotentiary, representing Russia, Austria,
Prussia, England, and France, held on November 21, 1818,
Way's memorandum, together with his elaborate, printed project
for a pan-European "reform of the civil and political
legislation" affecting the Jews, came up for discussion. The
diplomats, who were least of all concerned about the Jewish
question, and had no desire to make this "domestic affair" of
each Government an object of international negotiations,
agreed upon the following resolution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>Without entering into the merits of the view entertained by the
author of the project, the conference recognizes the justice of his
general tendency, and takes cognizance of the fact that the plenipotentiaries
of Austria and Prussia [Metternich and Hardenberg]
have declared themselves ready to furnish all possible information
concerning the Jewish situation in those two monarchies in order
to clarify a problem which must claim the attention equally of
the statesman and the humanitarian.</p></div>

<p>By means of this hollow, liberal-sounding phrase, which did
not involve the slightest obligation, the diplomats managed
to rid themselves of this vexatious problem, even the perfunctory
attention given to it at the Congress having been prompted
by no other motive than consideration for the Russian Emperor.
For the rest, every one of the three allied Governments
which had distributed Poland among themselves went on to
handle "its" Jews according to the requirements of its
domestic policy, which was frankly reactionary, and was not
even disguised by the fictitious label of humanitarianism.</p>

<p>The same domestic policy continued in Russia. The Tzar,
who abroad had listened benevolently to Way's appeal for the
civil emancipation of the Jews, irrespective of the future salvation
of their souls, decided, when at home again, to leave
everything untouched, looking for a partial solution of the
Jewish problem to the fantastic endeavors of the Society of
Israelitish Christians. Undeterred by the fact that the solemn
appeal issued by the Tzar in 1817 had, during the three years
since its promulgation, failed to attract a single group of converts,
for the simple reason that such groups were not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
existence, there being only rare isolated instances of baptism,
prompted in most cases by questionable motives, the Government
set aside, in 1820, a large tract of land in the Government
of Yekaterinoslav for a future settlement of "Israelitish
Christians." It even appointed a special official, with the title
Curator, to take charge of it.</p>

<p>But year after year passed by and the empty land was waiting
in vain for settlers, while the idle Curator was just as vainly on
the lookout for someone to take care of. At last, in 1823, an
obscure group of "Israelitish Christians" appeared on the
scene. It consisted of thirty-seven families from Odessa, who
expressed their willingness to accept the free lands with all the
manifold rights and privileges attached to them. Subsequent
inquiries from the office of the Governor-General of New Russia
revealed the fact, however, that the claimants to the public
pie, though confessing the Greek Orthodox faith, did not possess
certificates of baptism, and could not even produce passports,
with the result that the application of the adventurers
was denied.</p>

<p>At last, realizing the impracticability of the whole missionary
scheme, Count Golitzin advised Alexander I., in 1824, to
dissolve the mythical Society of Israelitish Christians with its
Board of Trustees, which by that time carried a whole staff
of Government officials on its budget. The Tzar refused to
liquidate by official action an undertaking which had been
heralded so solemnly, and the society without a membership,
administered by trustees without a trust, continued to figure on
the lists of Government institutions until 1833, when Nicholas
I. issued a curt ukase putting a sudden end to this bureaucratic
phantom. The new ruler had in the meantime discovered entirely
different and by no means fantastic contrivances for driving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
the Jews into the fold of the Orthodox Church. These contrivances
were the military barracks and the institution of
Cantonists.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">3. "Judaizing" Sects in Russia</span></p>

<p>While the Russian authorities were dreaming of a wholesale
conversion of Jews to Christianity, their attention was diverted
by the ominous spectacle of huge numbers of Christians embracing
a doctrine closely akin to Judaism. The Russian
officials disclosed the existence of a sect of "Sabbatarians"
and "Judaizers" in the Governments of Voronyezh, Saratov,
and Tula, all of them without Jewish residents, who might
otherwise have been suspected of a missionary propaganda
among the Greek Orthodox. The new "Judaizing" heresy
first engaged the attention of the central Government in 1817,
when a group of peasants in the region of Voronyezh addressed
a petition to the Tzar in which they naively complained of "the
oppressions which they had had to undergo at the hands of the
local authorities, both ecclesiastic and civil, on account of
their confessing the law of Moses." Acting under Imperial
instructions, Golitzin gave orders "to examine most rigorously"
the origin of the "sect," for the purpose of preventing
its further spread and bringing back the renegades into the
fold of Orthodoxy.</p>

<p>The Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Voronyezh reported, in
substance, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sect came into existence about 1796<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> "through natural
Jews." It afterwards spread to several settlements in the districts
of Bobrov and Pavlovsk. The essence of the sect, without being
directly an Old Testament form of Jewish worship, consists of a
few [Jewish] ceremonies, such as Sabbath observance and circumcision,
the arbitrary manner of contracting and dissolving
marriages, the way of burying the dead, and prayer assemblies.
The number of avowed sectarians amounts to one thousand five
hundred souls of both sexes, but the secret ones are in all likelihood
more numerous.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>To exterminate the sect, the Archbishop of Voronyezh proposes
various measures, to be carried out partly by the ecclesiastic
authorities and partly by the police, among them the
deportation of the soldier Anton Rogov, the propagandist of
the heresy.</p>

<p>Similar reports from the ecclesiastic authorities of Tula,
Orlov, Saratov, and other Great Russian Church districts were
soon received by the Synod. The "Judaizing heresy" spread
rapidly to the villages and cities, appealing alike to peasants
and merchants. Whenever taken to task, the sectarians declared
that they longed to return to the Old Testament and
"maintain the faith of their fathers, the Judeans."</p>

<p>The central authorities were alarmed, and resorted to
extraordinary measures to check the spread of the schism. The
Committee of Ministers approved the following draconian
project submitted by Count Kochubay in 1823:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The chiefs and teachers of the Judaizing sects are to be impressed
into military service, and those unfit to serve deported to
Siberia. All Jews are to be expelled from the districts in which
the sect of Sabbatarians or "Judeans" has made its appearance.
Intercourse between the Orthodox inhabitants and the sectarians
is to be thwarted in every possible manner. Every outward display
of the sect, such as the holding of prayer-meetings and the
observance of ceremonies which bear no resemblance to those
of Christians, is to be forbidden. Finally, to make the sectarians
an object of contempt, instructions are to be given to designate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>the Sabbatarians as a Jewish<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> sect and to publish far and wide that
they are in reality Zhyds, inasmuch as their present designation
as Sabbatarians, or adherents of the Mosaic law, does not give
the people a proper idea concerning this sect, and does not excite
in them that feeling of disgust which must be produced by the
realization that what is actually aimed at is to turn them into
Zhyds.</p></div>

<p>All these police regulations, in addition to a scheme of
disciplinary ecclesiastic measures, proposed by the Synod for
the purpose "of uprooting the Judean sect," were sanctioned by
Alexander I. (February and September, 1825). The tragic
consequences of these reprisals came to light only during the
following reign. Entire settlements were laid waste, thousands
of sectarians were banished to Siberia and the Caucasus. Many
of them, unable to endure the persecution, returned to the Orthodox
faith, but in many cases they did so outwardly, continuing
in secret to cling to their sectarian tenets.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">4. Recrudescence of Anti-Jewish Legislation</span></p>

<p>As far as the Jews are concerned, the immediate result of
these measures was insignificant. The number of Jews
involved in the decree of expulsion from the affected Great
Russian Governments was infinitesimal, since, owing to the
restriction of the Jewish right of residence, the only Jews
occasionally to be found there were a few traveling salesmen
or distillers. Yet, indirectly, the Judaizing movement had a
harmful effect upon the position of Russian Jewry. The Government
circles of St. Petersburg, which were religiously attuned,
were irritated by the fact that so many from the Orthodox
fold went over to the camp of the very people among whom
the Government had been hunting vainly for proselytes, and
while the colonies so hospitably prepared for the Israelitish
Christians were clamoring for inhabitants, many Great Russian
villages had to be stripped of their inhabitants, who were
deported to Siberia, on account of their Jewish leanings. In
the mind of Golitzin, the Minister of Ecclesiastic Affairs, the
opinion gained ground that "the Jews are enjoined by their
tenets to convert everybody to their religion." These circumstances
produced in Russian official circles a frame of mind
conducive to repressive measures, and helped to provide a
moral justification for them. Accordingly, the last years of
Alexander I.'s reign were marked by a recrudescence of religious
oppression, which at times assumed the dimensions of
wholesale persecutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>Sentiments of this kind were responsible for the medieval
prohibition against keeping Christian domestics. The prohibition
was suggested by Golitzin, a man otherwise far removed
from anti-Semitic prejudices, and was officially justified
in the Senatorial ukase of April 22, 1820, by the alleged proselytism
of the Jews. As instances of the latter the Senate quotes
the Judaizing movement in the Government of Voronyezh,
the communication of the Governor of Kherson concerning
certain Christian domestics in Jewish homes, who had adopted
Jewish customs and ceremonies, and so forth.</p>

<p>The same motives, strengthened by the tendency of removing
the Jews from the villages, long since pursued by the Government,
suggested harsher restrictions in letting to Jews
manorial estates with the peasant "souls" attached to them.
Ukases issued in 1819 and in subsequent years enjoin the local
administration to prosecute all so-called "krestentzya" contracts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
transactions whereby the squire leased the harvest of a
given year to a Jew, entitling him to employ the peasants
for gathering the grain and hay and for other agricultural
labors. Such transactions were looked upon as a criminal encroachment
of the Jews upon the right of owning slaves, which
was the prerogative of the nobles. Orders were accordingly
given, that all such farm leases be taken away from the Jews,
in spite of the complete ruin of the Jewish lessees, who were
left to settle their accounts with the squires.</p>

<p>At the same time the Government set out again to realize its
devout consummation&mdash;the expulsion of the Jews from the villages
and hamlets already provided for by the Statute of 1804,
though suspended for a time when the cruelty of the measure
spelling ruin to tens of thousands of Jewish families had
become apparent. The arguments by means of which the
Jewish Committee had endeavored in 1812 to convince, and
finally did convince, the Government of the impracticability
of such a migration of nations, were blotted out from memory.
The local and central authorities were again on the war path
against the Jews. To renew the campaign against the rural
Jews, the methods which had been tried with success in the
time of Dyerzhavin were again resorted to. When, in 1821,
hapless White Russia was again stricken by a famine, which
affected the Jews to a considerable extent, the local nobility
was once more on the alert, placing the whole responsibility
for the ruin of the peasantry on the Jewish tenants and saloon-keepers.
The landlords proposed that the Government expel
all the Jews from the province or at least forbid them to sell
spirits in the rural settlements, since the Jews "lead the
peasants into ruin." The local authorities, in reply to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
inquiry of Senator Baranov, who had been dispatched from St.
Petersburg to White Russia, expressed a similar opinion.</p>

<p>The question was first brought up before the Committee
which was charged with the task of giving relief to the
Governments of White Russia, and included several ministers,
among them the all-powerful Arakcheyev. The Relief Committee
approved the restrictive project of the nobility, and so,
a little later, did the Committee of Ministers. The result was a
stern ukase of the Tzar, addressed, on April 11, 1823, to the
governors of White Russia, to the following effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) To forbid the Jews in all the settlements of the Governments
of Moghilev and Vitebsk to hold land leases, to keep public
houses, saloons, hostelries, posts, and even to live in them
[in the villages], whereby all farming contracts of this kind are
to become null and void by January 1, 1824. (2) To transplant all
the Jews in these two Governments from the settlements into the
cities and towns by January 1, 1825.</p></div>

<p>In signing this ukase, which spelled sorrow and misery for
thousands of families, Alexander I. gave verbal instructions
to the Committee of Ministers, to point out to the White Russian
Governor-General Khovanski "ways and means of obtaining
employment and designating sources of livelihood for the
local Jews in their new places of abode." But no "ways and
means" of any kind could mitigate the misery of people
doomed to expulsion from their old nests and reduced to
beggary and vagrancy.</p>

<p>Immediately on the receipt of the ukase the local authorities
embarked upon their task with relentless cruelty. By January,
1824, over twenty thousand Jews of both sexes had been driven
from the villages of both Governments. Hordes of hapless refugees,
with their wives and children, began to flock into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
overcrowded towns and townlets. There they could be seen,
stripped almost to their shirts, wandering aimlessly in the
streets. They lived in frightful congestion, as many as ten
of them being squeezed into a single room. They were huddled
together in the synagogues, while many of them, unable to find
shelter, remained on the streets with their families facing the
winter cold. Sickness and increased mortality began to spread
among them, particularly in the city of Nevel. Even the anti-Jewish
Governor-General Khovanski, who was making a tour
of inspection through the stricken district, was stirred by the
spectacle, and advised the Committee of Ministers to stop the
disastrous expulsions. But the blow had been dealt. By the
beginning of 1825 the majority of rural Jews had been expatriated,
and turned out into the wide world.</p>

<p>The question naturally arises, whether this human holocaust
was required in the interest of the country. The Government
itself gave the answer twelve years later&mdash;when it was too late.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As far as White Russia is concerned&mdash;quoth the Council of State
in 1835&mdash;experience has not justified our anticipations of the usefulness
of the indicated measure [the expulsion from the villages].
Twelve years have passed since it was carried into effect, but
from the data collected in the Department of Law it is quite
manifest, that, while it has ruined the Jews, it does not in the least
seem to have improved the condition of the villagers.</p></div>

<p>The White Russian orgy of destruction was merely the prelude
to a new legislative campaign against the Jews. Almost
simultaneously with the ukase ordering the expulsion of the
Jews from the villages, another ukase was issued on May 1,
1823, calling for the establishment of a new "Committee for
the Amelioration of the Jews." The Committee, which included
among its members the Ministers of Interior, Finance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
Justice, Ecclesiastic Affairs, and Public Instruction, was intrusted
with a very comprehensive piece of work&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>to examine the enactments concerning Jews passed up to date and
point out the way in which their presence in the country might be
rendered more comfortable and useful, also what obligations they
are to assume towards the Government; in a word, to indicate
all that may contribute towards the amelioration of the civil
status of this people.</p></div>

<p>In these soft-spoken terms was couched the <i>public</i> function
of the Committee. But its <i>secret</i> function, which later revealed
itself in action, is correctly defined in the frank admission
of the Committee of Ministers in its report of 1829: "At the
very establishment of the Jewish Committee one of the obligations
imposed upon it was to devise ways and means looking
generally towards the reduction of the number of Jews in the
monarchy." This was evidently what "the amelioration of
the civil status" of the Jews amounted to. The new Committee
was instructed to finish its work by the beginning of 1824, but
its reactionary activity was not fully unfolded until the following
reign.</p>

<p>In the meantime the legal machinery did not remain idle.
The process of the territorial compression of Jews went on
as before. To guard the western frontier of the monarchy
against smuggling, it was decided, at the suggestion of the
Administrator of the Kingdom of Poland, Grand Duke Constantine
Pavlovich, to expel the Jews from the border zone.
Two ukases were issued in 1825 ordering the removal of all
the Jews residing outside the cities within fifty versts from the
frontier, with the exception of those owning immovable property.
Once again human beings were hurled from their lifelong
domiciles, when a rational policy would have been content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
with instituting a closer watch. To prevent the undesirable
"multiplication of Jews" in the border Governments, Jewish
emigrants from neighboring countries, particularly from Austria,
were forbidden to settle in Russia (1824).</p>

<p>Needless to say, the Governments of the interior, where the
Jews could sojourn only temporarily, and where they had to
produce gubernatorial passports, like foreigners, were carefully
guarded against the invasion of the residents of the Pale.
On his last trip from St. Petersburg to Southern Russia in
September, 1825, Alexander I. espied, in a little village near
Luga,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> a Jewish family, which was engaged in making tin-plate,
and he at once inquired "on what ground" it lived there.
The Governor of St. Petersburg was frightened, and gave
orders to have the family deported immediately from the
district, to censure the local <i>ispravnik</i><a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and to warn the gubernatorial
authorities, "that the rules concerning the Jews must
be observed with all possible stringency."</p>


<p>5. <span class="smcap">The Russian Revolutionaries and the Jews</span></p>

<p>Such was the attitude of the Russian <i>Government</i> towards
the Jews. But what was the attitude of the Russian <i>people</i>?
Considering the character of the age, in which public opinion
was not able to express itself even in political literature, an
answer to this question would be entirely impossible, had not
the revolutionary movement of the Decembrists<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> disclosed the
frame of mind of the most progressive section of Russian
society in its relation to the Jewish question. Taken as a whole
it was an unfriendly attitude. It reflects the utter estrangement
in language, in manners, and in culture between Jews and
Russians at that time, an estrangement which breeds suspicion
and hostility. The Russian knew no more of the life of the
secluded Jewish populace than he did of the life of the Chinese.
The educated Russian looked with suspicion upon the exclusiveness
of patriarchal Jewish life, the unintelligible religious
ceremonies which surrounded it, the rigorism of the rabbis,
the ecstasy of the Tzaddiks, the strange emotionalism of the
Hasidic masses. If he turned to books for an explanation
of these strange phenomena, he would find it in the current
pamphlet literature of Germany or Poland, with its hackneyed
phrases about the fanaticism of the "chosen people," a "state
in a state," etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>The attitude of the Decembrists<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> towards the Jewish problem
reflects the conventional ideas of an age of reaction. The
"Russian Truth" by Pestel contains a chapter entitled "On
the Tribes Populating Russia," in which the Jewish problem is
described as an almost indissoluble political tangle. Pestel
enumerates the peculiar Jewish characteristics which, in his
opinion, render the Jews entirely unfit for membership in a
social order. The Jews "foster among themselves incredibly
close ties"; they have "a religion of their own, which instils
into them the belief that they are predestined to conquer all
nations," and "makes it impossible for them to mix with any
other nation." The rabbis<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> wield unlimited sway over the
masses; they keep the people in spiritual bondage, "forbidding
the reading of all books except the Talmud" and other
religious writings. The Jews "are waiting for the coming of
the Messiah, who is to establish them in their kingdom," and
therefore "look upon themselves as temporary residents of the
land in which they live." Hence their passion for commerce
and their neglect of agriculture and handicrafts. Since commerce
alone is unable to provide the huge masses of Jews with
a livelihood, cheating and trickery are considered permissible,
to the injury of the Christians. Pestel has no eye for the heavy
burden of Jewish disabilities, and even considers the Jews
a privileged class of the population, since they do not furnish
any recruits, have their own rabbinical tribunals, possess
"the right of educating their children in whatever principles
they like," and "moreover enjoy all the rights of the Christian
nations"(!).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the vein in which a Russian revolutionary leader
wrote, not knowing, or perhaps not caring to know, of the
iron vise of the Pale of Settlement, of the pitiless expulsions
which were taking place just at that time, ignorant altogether
of the whole mesh of legal restrictions which placed the Jews
on the lowest rung of Russian rightlessness.</p>

<p>After presenting this picture of Jewish life, Pestel suggests
to the future revolutionary Government ("The Supreme Provisional
Administration") two ways of solving the Jewish
problem. One consists in breaking up "the influence of the
close relationship among the Jews so injurious to the Christians,"
because it keeps them apart from the other citizens.
For this purpose he advises convoking "the most learned rabbis
and the most intelligent Jews"&mdash;Pestel had evidently heard of
Napoleon's Synhedrion&mdash;"listening to their representations,"
and thereupon adopting measures for eradicating Jewish exclusiveness,
for, "inasmuch as Russia does not expel the Jews,
they ought to be the more careful not to adopt an unfriendly
attitude towards the Christians."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>The second way consists in an honorable expulsion of the
Jews or, to use his words, "in assisting the Jews to form
a separate commonwealth of their own in some portion of Asia
Minor." To this end Pestel makes the proposal to choose a
rallying-point for the Jewish people and to supply them with
some troops so as to reinforce them. For, as Pestel continues,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>were all the Russian and Polish Jews to congregate in one place,
they would number over two millions. Such a mass of people,
being in search of a fatherland would not find it difficult to overcome
all obstacles which the Turks might place in their way, and,
after traversing the whole of European Turkey, might pass over
into Asiatic Turkey, and, having occupied an adequate area, form
a separate Jewish State.</p></div>

<p>Pestel himself felt more attracted towards the latter alternative
of solving the Jewish problem,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> but, being fully aware
that "this gigantic undertaking depends on particular circumstances,"
he did not formulate it as "a special obligation
upon the Supreme Administration."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Accordingly, if Pestel's first plan had materialized, the Jews
of Russia would have received from the Supreme Provisional
Administration, not civil equality, but a stern <i>Reglement</i> of
the Austrian or Old Prussian type, made up of a long string of
"correctional measures" aiming at compulsory assimilation or
Russification, at the demolition of the whole cultural autonomy
of Russian Jewry, not excluding "the right of educating their
children in whatever principles they like," and finally culminating
in the economic "curbing of Jewry," perhaps in the spirit
of that very Government against which the Decembrists were
fighting.</p>

<p>Pestel's views on Judaism were shared by many Decembrists,
but not by all. The constitution drafted by the leader of
the "Northern Society," Nikita Muravyov, originally proposed
to grant political rights to the Jews only within their Pale
of Settlement, but in the second draft this limitation was
replaced by the principle of perfect equality.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
